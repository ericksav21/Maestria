 pounds and stands six feet in his socks What a tremendous fellow he was sighed Ato sinking dreamily back in his hammock and half closing his eyes Ill never forget how high and handsome he looked when Queen Ozma asked him to give up buccaneering and serve her instead as Royal Discoverer and Explorer for Oz And a fitting reward it was too for capturing Ruggedo and saving the Kingdom Aha my lad THAT was a day And we had our share of the glory too Remember how they cheered us in the Emerald City of Oz Aye I remember THAT day and a good many other days since sniffed the Read Bird disagreeably Six months from that day Samuel Salt was to sail into our Harbor Well King its been six times six months and nary a sail nor a sign of him have we seen That long said Ato blinking unhappily That long and longer Three years eleven months twentysix days and twelve hours to be exact Dear dear and dear Then somethings happened to him murmured Ato Hes either been shipwrecked captured or enchanted Ill never believe Sammy would forget us or break his promise Never Well whatever you believe the results are the same Flapping open his book Roger prepared to go on with his reading And depend upon it he insisted stubbornly well never see Samuel Salt again so you may as well put up your telescope and put your mind on something else for a change Maybe its your cooking thats keeping him away finished the Read Bird who felt cross and fractious and contrary as a goat My cooking roared Ato roused to honest anger at last Ive a notion to have you plucked and roasted for that My cooking indeed Show me the fellow who can beat up an omelet a cake a batch of biscuits faster than I Who can brown a fowl broil a steak or toss out a pan of fried potatoes to compare with mine I C4 I why Im surprised at you Roger Roger ruffling his feathers uncomfortably was rather surprised at himself for the King was speaking the exact truth A more skillful man with a skillet it would be impossible to find in any kingdom Ever since his voyage on the Crescent Moon cooking had been Atos chief pleasure and pastime The castle chef though he heartily disapproved of a King in the kitchen could do nothing to discourage him so finally stood by in grudging envy and admiration as Ato turned out his delectable puddings pies roasts and sauces Muttering with hurt pride and indignation his Majesty continued to frown at the Read Bird and realizing he had gone too far Roger started to read as fast as he could from the Book of Barons As he read on he could see the King growing calmer and finally pausing to turn a page he let his gaze rove idly over the harbor Anchors and animal crackers What was that Stretching up his neck Roger took another look then flinging the Book of Barons high into the air he spread his wings and started out to sea Soothed by the droning voice of the Read Bird Ato had closed his eyes and the first warning he had of Rogers departure was a terrific thump as the Book of Barons landed on his stomach Leaping out of the hammock as if he had been shot the outraged Monarch looked furiously around for his Read Bird This really was too much Not satisfied with insulting him Roger must now be bombarding him with books cocoanuts and what not Shading his eyes with his hand Ato glared up and down the beach and finally out over the rippling blue ocean At what he saw there the King forgot his anger as completely as Roger had forgotten his manners For swinging jauntily into the Octagon Harbor was the Crescent Moon herself No mistaking the highprowed deepwaisted powerful craft of the Pirate But a new and gayer pennant fluttered from the mizzenmast today Instead of the skull and bones Samuel was flying the green and white banner of Oz as befitted the Royal Discoverer and Explorer of the most famous Fairyland in History Hes here Hes come shouted Ato running wildly up and down Samuel SAMUEL In his delight and excitement the King forgot the Royal dock and began wading out into the bay Peering around his wheel Sammy saw him coming and broke into a loud cheerful greeting Hi King Ho King How are you you son of a Lubber Wait till I ease her in and Ill be ashore quicker than quick Roger had already reached the Crescent Moon and perched upon the Captains shoulder was chattering away at such a rate Samuel could hardly keep his mind on his steering But he was an old hand at such matters and before Ato had half recovered from the shock of seeing him the shining threemasted vessel was made fast and its Master striding exuberantly up the wet planks of the royal dock Ahoy Ahoy he boomed boisterously What a day for a voyage Is it really my old cook and shipmate None other puffed Ato seizing both of the former pirates hands But what have you done to yourself Samuel Wheres your sash and scimitar And whats that on your head may I ask You dont look natural or seamanlike at all Oh dont mind these grinned the Pirate touching his threecornered hat and satin coat apologetically These are my shore togs f
