ps of seaweed had been arranged to form the words COME SEE THE CURIOUS HIGH AIR MANSTER ADMISSION 1 PEARL 5 CORALS AND A CLAM The sight of this sign swinging from a small sea tree close to Samuels air bowl sent a wave of rage up Tandys back Rubbing his palms briskly together the little boy seized the saw and struck it with all his might against the unyielding surface of the slide The noise attracted Samuels attention and looking up he began waving his arms yelling out wild orders and commands Not being able to hear any of them and being quite sure Samuel was telling them to leave the air shaft before the Seeweegians shot another slide over their heads and caught them too Tandy proceeded grimly with his task Roger helped scraping away with both claws and bill For five desperate minutes they worked without success then a tiny crack split the slide from edge to edge Wedging the saw into the narrow opening Tandy began sawing away like a little wild man for a fresh batch of snails and crabs tossed into Samuel had let in another rush of sea water Immersed to his chin Samuel started to swim round and round dodging the end of the saw as it flashed up and down above his head Oh gasped Tandy stopping a moment to blow on his fingers Ill never be able to make this opening large enough Look look Roger theyre opening that trap door again Oh oh I cant bear it Help Help yelled the Read Bird looking despairingly up the empty air shaft Help for the love of sea salt and sailor men His cry increased by the curious nature of the compressed air in the air shaft increased a hundredfold and fell with a hideous roar upon the anguished ears of Ato and Nikobo Almost instinctively and without thought of her own safety or Atos or the dire consequences the hippopotamus jumped bodily into the sea hole Roger still glaring upward had a quick flash of an immense falling object Realizing at once what had happened the Read Bird had just time to snatch Tandy and drag him to the opposite side of the slide before Nikobo landed broke through the thick glass plunged into Samuels aquarium and shot out through the side into a group of horrified Seeweegians Now do not suppose for an instant that Tandy Roger or Samuel himself saw all this happen Indeed after Nikobo struck the slide none of them remembered a thing for the ocean rushing in through the puncture the hippopotamus had made in the vacuum rose like a tidal wave carrying them tumultuously along Nikobo came up at a little distance from the others with Ato completely wrapped and entangled in seaweed clinging tenaciously to her harness and looking like some queer marine specimen himself Too shocked and stunned to swim the five shipmates bobbed up and down like corks on the surface of the sea Then Roger spreading his wet and bedraggled wings and coughing violently from all the salt water he had swallowed started dizzily back to the Crescent Moon Nikobo had several long gashes in her tough hide but still managed to grin at Tandy I C4 I must have lost the saw panted the little boy pulling himself wearily up on her back Never mind the saw I still have my journal and look what I caught puffed Samuel Salt dragging himself up on the other side of the hippopotamus Ship ahoy Mates a live and perfect specimen of a jellyfish boy Holding up his prize Samuel smiled blandly all his danger and discomfort apparently forgotten Oh my eyes ears and whiskers quavered Ato peering out of his net of seaweed Is it for this weve been scraping our noses on the sea bottom Nodding cheerfully Samuel plunged the squirming and transparent little water boy under the surface holding him there as Nikobo swam slowly and painfully back to the ship CHAPTER 16 THE STORM Tandy was so exhausted from his dreadful experiences at the bottom of the sea hole he spent the rest of the morning flat on his stomach on deck making lively sketches from memory of the City of Seeweegia Of the sea hole itself not a sign nor vestige remained The sea tumbling through the breach made by Nikobo had closed it up forever and ever Ato had Roger fetch bandages and witch hazel down to the raft and it took him two hours to bind up the cuts and hurts of the faithful hippopotamus Then climbing wearily up the rope ladder to the deck he spent another hour rubbing himself with oil and liniment muttering darkly about reckless collectors who got themselves and their shipmates collected What would WE have done if youd never got out of that air bowl scolded Ato waving the bottle of liniment at the Captain who was cheerfully changing into dry clothes You know I know nothing about navigation nor one sail from tother Ah but what you know about sauces retorted Samuel rolling his eyes rapturously Of course Ill grant a ship cannot sail on its stomach but if the worst had come to the worst you could have left a note for the sails on the binnacle If it comes up a blow tie yourselves up Ha ha Tie yourselves UP Jamming his feet into his boots Samuel blew a kiss to his still mutt
