enches tables and chairs But there were no beds at all I wonder if these people never sleep said the girl Why there seems to be no night at all in this country Zeb replied Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we came and if there is no sunset there can be no night Very true agreed the Wizard But it is a long time since I have had any sleep and Im tired So I think I shall lie down upon one of these hard glass benches and take a nap I will too said Dorothy and chose a little room at the end of the hall Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim who when he found himself free rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep with Eureka nestling comfortably beside his big boney body Then the boy returned to one of the upper rooms and in spite of the hardness of the glass bench was soon deep in slumberland 6 The Mangaboos Prove Dangerous When the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the Land of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival The little man having had a good sleep felt rested and refreshed and looking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up on his bench and yawning So the Wizard went in to him Zeb said he my balloon is of no further use in this strange country so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell But in the basketcar are some things I would like to keep with me I wish you would go and fetch my satchel two lanterns and a can of kerosene oil that is under the seat There is nothing else that I care about So the boy went willingly upon the errand and by the time he had returned Dorothy was awake Then the three held a counsel to decide what they should do next but could think of no way to better their condition I dont like these vegtable people said the little girl Theyre cold and flabby like cabbages in spite of their prettiness I agree with you It is because there is no warm blood in them remarked the Wizard And they have no hearts so they cant love anyonenot even themselves declared the boy The Princess is lovely to look at continued Dorothy thoughtfully but I dont care much for her after all If there was any other place to go Id like to go there But IS there any other place asked the Wizard I dont know she answered Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cabhorse calling to them and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and a throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady who said to them I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people and we have decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not remain here How can we go away asked Dorothy Oh you cannot go away of course so you must be destroyed was the answer In what way enquired the Wizard We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines said the Princess and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies to make themselves grow bigger The animals you have with you we will drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit Then our country will be rid of all its unwelcome visitors But you are in need of a Sorcerer said the Wizard and not one of those growing is yet ripe enough to pick I am greater than any thorncovered sorcerer that every grew in your garden Why destroy me It is true we need a Sorcerer acknowledged the Princess but I am informed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days to take the place of Gwig whom you cut in two before it was time for him to be planted Let us see your arts and the sorceries you are able to perform Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others or not At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again He did it very cleverly indeed and the Princess looked at the strange piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could be But afterward she said I have heard of this wonderful magic But it accomplishes nothing of value What else can you do The Wizard tried to think Then he jointed together the blades of his sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose But even that did not satisfy the Princess Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon and he got a clever idea from those commonplace things Your Highness said he I will now proceed to prove my magic by creating two suns that you have never seen before also I will exhibit a Destroyer much more dreadful that your Clinging Vines So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and set a lantern upon each of their heads Dont laugh he whispered to them or you will spoil the effect of my magic Then with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled face the Wizard got out his matchbox and lighted the two lanterns The glare they made was very small when compared wit
