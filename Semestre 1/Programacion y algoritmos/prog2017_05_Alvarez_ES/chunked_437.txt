n put bells on their animals Just keep still and dont move and they wont notice us at all Flattening themselves against the rocks at the foot of the mountain the five adventurers waited tensely But when a huge shaggy shape loomed out of the darkness and came charging straight toward them all five screamed and started to slither sideways Wait Dont run Dont be frightened begged an agitated voice Dont you know me Its I Its me THE WIZARD CHAPTER 16 ESCAPE FROM RED TOP As the great stag came to a sliding halt the rays from his silver lantern cast a wavering light over the little group crouched against the rocks Hello How ever did you escape from the castle demanded Ozmas little Magician sliding recklessly off the high back of his steed and embracing them jubilantly We were just coming to help you Girls Scarecrow Soldier Lion may I present Azarine the real Princess of this Mountain and Shagomar and Dear Deer her friends Dorothy and Jellia were so stunned by the unexpected appearance of the Wizard they were able only to manage a couple of breathless bows And indeed the lovely picture Azarine made seated demurely on the huge red stag was enough to render anyone speechless Shaggy himself was breathtaking too Not only the lantern and bell hung from his antlers now but perched unconcernedly on the tallest prong was a lovely white pigeon with a key in his bill This pigeon was going to fly up to the tower with the key to the door explained the Wizard as his five comrades continued to gaze at him in stupefied silence Fortunately Azarine who was imprisoned there before you had an extra key She said Bustabo would lock you up in the tower exclaimed the Wizard with a nod at the Princess But since you already are out and down well not need the key Tell me how did you manage to escape What did you do Break down the door No we just stepped out the window the Scarecrow told him with a nonchalant wave upward You mean you jumped all this distance gasped Azarine leaning forward to peer between Shaggys branching antlers while Dear Deer trotted closer to nudge Dorothy with her soft moist nose Well sort of explained Jellia putting an arm around the Cowardly Lion who still was looking extremely sulky But first we put on those fallingout suits Wiz and youll be glad to know they really worked Splendid Splendid beamed the Wizard with a satisfied shake of his head You know Id completely forgotten them but I felt sure youd find some useful magic in the kit Did Bustabo keep his promises Well he locked us up in the tower and he gave us a pretty good supper answered Dorothy But we didnt like being prisoners and we didnt feel safe in that castle Then a little while ago when we heard him thumping up the stair we just decided to leave And so C4 we left So we see So we see The Wizard grinned appreciatively delighted by the spirit of the two girls But perhaps wed better be off No knowing when Bustabo and his Bowmen will be coming to look for you Shagomar and Dear Deer have kindly agreed to carry us to the castle of Glinda the Good Once there with Glindas magic to help me Ill find some way to deal with Strut and to force Bustabo to give up Azarines throne Now suppose you two girls and the Scarecrow mount Dear Deer and the Soldier and I will ride with the Princess Dear Deer at the Wizards words moved over to a flat rock Without any trouble at all Jellia and Dorothy climbed to places on her back Then the Scarecrow vaulted up behind clasping his arms round Jellia to keep from slipping off When Wantowin and the Wizard had mounted behind Azarine the two Deer swung away from the mountain With the Cowardly Lion loping easily between they ran swiftly toward the Southlands Their gait was so smooth it seemed to Jellia they were flying like figures in a dream through the shadowy forest with only the twinkle of the silver lantern to light their way As they raced along Azarine again told the story of Bustabos treachery and how Shagomar had brought the Wizard to her hidden cave Then the two girls amused the little Princess with the story of their experiences in the Strat They told her all about their life at home in the Emerald City and of the curious celebrities who lived in the palace with Ozma Azarine already was charmed with the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion and kept leaning down to have a better look at the tawny beast trotting so unconcernedly between the two deer I tell you she proposed generously I tell you if Strut destroys the Emerald City you all can come back and live with me That is if Glinda and the Wizard can make Bustabo give my castle and Kingdom back But I do hope well find some way to stop Strut How long will it take him to reach the capitol Dorothy called across to the Wizard Well it took us a night and half a day to fly to Stratovania calculated the little Magician wrinkling his forehead So Im afraid if Strut and the Tin Woodman left yesterday theyll be in the Emerald City tomorrow That is today And its almost morning now shivered Jellia gl
