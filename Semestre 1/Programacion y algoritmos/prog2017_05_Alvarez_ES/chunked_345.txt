shed barrels of molasses on their heads and wed better dash on while theyre stopped and stuck with it Then youve been breaking the law again reproached Nox dodging in and out and around their frantic enemies Well as between broken heads and broken laws I choose the laws Besides look what they did to me exclaimed the Goat Girl indignantly I may never get this hoop off or be able to lift a hand again Nice people you have in Oz I must say If you hadnt hit them with stones they wouldnt have hit us with hoops Nox reminded her sternly at the same time breaking into a gallop to put as much distance as possible between himself and the troublesome Gillikins A few had managed to lift the barrels from their heads but most of them were rolling over and over on the ground half choked with rage and molasses When we stop I think I can help you promised Nox looking anxiously at Handy who was now quite purple in the face from her struggles with the hoop Just forget it cant you and think of the interesting people we are meeting Ill wager you have no hooknoses on Mt Mern I should say NOT sputtered the Goat Girl in disgust and then realizing she was making no progress with the ring sensibly gave up the attempt to free herself Somewhat comforted by the thought that the Hook Noses were probably as uncomfortable as she was Handy kept a sharp lookout for natives If they ran into any more she wanted to be sure of seeing them first But the rocky hills and glades were entirely deserted and at every step the way became more mountainous and lonely Nox panting and wheezing from the long pull slackened his pace to a walk Handy Mandy with some difficulty managed to dismount and the Ox slipping his horn under the offending ring gently forced it upward till the Goat Girl was able to wriggle free Then together they climbed up the flinty inclines C4 up and up till they came to a wide ledge and a sparkling waterfall Here they had a drink without having to wish for one Nox sticking his head right into the water and Handy cupping three pairs of her hands to hold enough to satisfy her thirst Ho hum sighed the Ox I wonder how much farther well have to go before we can find anyone who can direct us to this Silver Mountain Im sure I saw some castles when we were below So did I said Handy screwing his right horn back with a businesslike flourish MyC4y seems a long time since we started from Keretaria Do you suppose they have missed us yet Probably yawned the Ox scratching his back against a rock while Handy suddenly deciding she needed another drink stepped close to the waterfall But instead of quenching her thirst the Goat Girl spilled water all over her feet Nox Nox she screamed jerking all her thumbs in his direction Come Look here Theres a big hollow behind this waterfall C4 a high wall of rock with a door in it I can see it Well sniffed the Ox rubbing his back luxuriously does it say come in Must we try every door we come to Yes Handy Mandy told him firmly we must Where theres a door theres bound to be a doorkeeper or at least someone who might tell us where we are Now then Ill jump through the waterfall first and knock on the door There wouldnt be room for you on the ledge until the door is open Sounds risky objected the Royal Ox putting back his ears What kind of people would live behind a waterfall Ask yourself that But the Goat Girl without stopping to ask herself anything had already plunged through the misty sheet of water and gasping and spluttering was hammering on the door with all seven of her fists CHAPTER 9 THE MAGIC HAMMER There was no answer to Handys loud knocks and pausing to catch her breath and blow on her fingers the Goat Girl wondered what to try next Then in spite of Noxs warning bellow she began to shove and push the wet planks with her shoulder But that did no good either so she felt in her pocket for something to use as a wedge Almost at once her fingers closed on the silver hammer they had plowed up in Keretaria While the hammer would not do for a wedge it would at least save her knuckles so lifting it high above her head Handy Mandy brought it down with a resounding whack A shower of silver sparks followed the hammer blow and Nox peering through the waterfall saw a gnarled and crooked elf with a purple beard dancing madly round the startled girl I am the elf of the hammer who Must do whatever you ask me to sang the elf between his high leaps and prances Then open this door directed Handy spinning round in a circle herself to get a good look at the little fellow MyC4y how funny Oz is Magic horns Topsies Hook Noses and now you Dont tell me a little body like you can really open this great heavy door Pick up the hammer and doubt no more C4 Himself the elf will now open the door In a daze Handy Mandy picked up the hammer and put it back in her pocket and Nox thunderstruck by the whole proceedings thrust his head through the waterfall just in time to see the knobby little gnome push the door open with one thump of his brown
