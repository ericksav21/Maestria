s a wooden sawhorse belonging to Ozma an Iffin whom Jack Pumpkinhead discovered near the Land of Barons and a dozen more unique and unusual characters The old pilgrim seemed to find the group in the garden surprising enough for he watched them closely and silently for almost ten minutes cupping his hand behind his ear in an endeavor to catch what the Wizard was saying It is just as I have told you the little Wizard was remarking earnestly to Tik Tok The great record book of Glinda has vanished from her castle without trace or reason and even with my powerful searchlight and looking glasses I have been unable to discover any signs of it Word of the theft came yesterday by pigeon post Someone has stolen it for no good purpose answered the Metal Man solemnly But the old man leaning over the hedge heard none of this for the two were conversing in low and guarded tones So after a long puzzled look at the Scarecrow the pilgrim took up his staff and shuffled along the goldpebbled path to the palace itself A pompous footman in gold and green came to answer his timid knock at the door What name please what business and why in the wood sic does a fellow like you come begging at the door of a castle inquired the footman in a loud displeased voice There there Puffup admonished a rosycheeked maid in a ribboned cap and apron peering around the wide shoulders of the footman Dont be so shouting proud Youve frightened the old gentleman half out of his wits Cant you see he is tired and hungry and probably in need of a lunch At the little maids kind speech the pilgrim bowed at least a dozen times nodding his head energetically to show that she was perfectly right in her conjecture Come along with you urged Jellia Jamb giving him a friendly wink Edging nervously past the muttering footman the old beggar followed Jellia into the castles spacious and splendid dining hall Wait right here and Ill bring you some cake and applesauce an omelette and a pot of tea promised the obliging girl How will that be Jellia Jamb who was Ozmas own personal maid and a privileged character around the castle grinned cheerfully at her ancient visitor and though the old monk pretended not to understand a word that she said he nevertheless seated himself at the table and with round eyes watched her skip through the swinging door into the pantry No sooner had Jellia disappeared than the old rascal sprang nimbly to his feet and began to peer eagerly all around him Passing hurriedly over a rich gold service on the sideboard he pounced upon an earthen jug on a crystal stand and tucking it under his robe slipped silently as a shadow out of the dining hall up the green carpeted stairs and straight into the private sitting room of Ozma of Oz Once there and without losing a moment he walked to the west wall took down a large goldframed picture blew upon it with a small glass tube till it was no larger than a cake of chocolate and thrust it into an inner pocket Then holding his robe high above his skinny shins and with the jug clasped tightly in his arms he galloped down the stairs and out an open window into the garden reaching a large clump of snowball bushes without encountering anyone Hiding himself well in the bushes he tore off the monks robe turned it inside out dragged a white wig from his sock and presently emerged as dignified and plausible an old grandmother as anyone would wish to see The other side of his monks robe was green and made up in a style much affected by old ladies in the capital so that now he attracted no attention whatever The jug in a large string bag dangled carelessly from his wrist and smiling and nodding amiably he hurried through the garden passed rapidly down one street and another through the city gates on and on till he was far out in the country walking faster and faster and less like a monk or an old lady at every step CHAPTER 14 THE ROBBERY IS DISCOVERED Prunes and peppermints ejaculated the Scarecrow springing up from his bench as Jellia Jamb with streaming eyes and cap ribbons came flying across the garden Peanuts and pretzels Dorothy about to hit the pole and win the game dropped her mallet at Jellias firesiren screeches while Ozma and the others swung round in amazement as the little waiting maid sobbing and panting rushed into their midst Oh that beggar Oh that pilgrim That old Monk or whatever he was wailed Jellia wiping her eyes on the corner of her apron Hes gone and stolen the jug I mean Rug and Oz knows what will become of us There there my girl Stop crying Begin at the beginning and tell us just what happened begged the Scarecrow patting Jellia clumsily on the shoulder But this is serious very serious muttered the Wizard who had at once realized the importance of the little maids news If Ruggedo is released from that jug and enchantment hell be up to his old tricks in no time and doing anything in his power to hurt and destroy us But who could have known we turned Ruggedo into a jug or where the jug was kept And
