 chance if I ever find a rocs egg and theres an island somewhere in these waters where rocs are known to nest Rock Island its called and a rocs nest would be something to see eh Kinglet Please dont call me that begged Tandy earnestly Roger says I dont have to be a King on this ship and I like not being a King Ha Ha And I like you that way myself roared Samuel tossing Tandy suddenly to his shoulder Why since youve stopped this King and son of a Kinging youre a seaman after my own heart and so long as the Crescent Moons afloat youve a berth on her Up with you Up with you Tomorrows another day Swinging gaily to the main deck Samuel tumbled Tandy into his bunk and went striding aft to take in his main and mizzen topsails Next morning while he and Ato were cutting up potatoes for Nikobo Tandy was not surprised to hear a loud hail from above Something had happened just as Samuel had predicted Running out with a paring knife still in his hand he saw a strange glittering mountainous island abaft the beam It was still a goodish sea mile away but with the glasses Ato generously pressed upon him Tandy made out the most curious bit of geography the eyes of a voyager had yet gazed on There was not a piece of level ground on the island anywhere Its high glittering needlelike peaks rose straight out of the sea with apparently no way of ascending or descending Of clear crystal reflecting every color of the rainbow the beautiful island was almost too dazzling to look at as it lay shimmering and sparkling in the bright sunshine As they sailed nearer Tandy saw that a perfect maze of high and airy bridges ran like a gigantic spider web between the peaks On these bridges all the islands life and activities seemed to take place Quaint fluted cottages were built in the center and along the perilous catwalks on either side raced the Mountaineers themselves brandishing glittering poles and spears and halberds Pikes on the peak Pikes on the peak Port your helm Sammy roared Ato Not too close Not too near Samuel Howd you like to be pinned to the mast with a spear or flattened on the deck with a boulder Ah now theyre just excited answered Samuel Salt squinting curiously up at the Bridgemen but Nikobo with her short legs resting on the top rail of her raft squealed out a dolorous warning Fighters Fighters These Pikers look savager than the Leopard Men Best back away Master Captain while theres still time Oh look LOOK Theres a ship on the mountain cried Tandy jerking Samuels sleeve right there where that torrent comes down between the bridges a threemaster larger than the Crescent Moon Then its a battle boomed Samuel bringing his helm hard around Stand by to man the guns Hoy all hands hoy While his shipmates sprang to attention Samuel darted from mast to mast touching the buttons on his sail controls AYE DE AYE OH LAY The shrill unexpected cry came from the highest bridge on the island and was immediately taken up and repeated by all the Pikemen on the lower bridges It resulted in such a mad medley of yodels that Ato clapped both hands to his ears and Nikobo plunged her head in her drinking tub Not only fighters but singers grunted Ato swinging the port gun into an upright position Beef beans and barley bread What a rumpus Tandy who with Roger had charge of the other gun could not help but admire the calm way Samuel Salt ignored the dreadful outcry from the bridges Whether the pikes of the islanders could be flung down upon them was still a question but as Tandy looked anxiously aloft he saw the great whitesailed ship of the Mountain Men sweeping toward the torrent It paused for a breathless instant on the top and then came rushing down upon them They were right in the path of the descending vessel which would strike them with such force both ships would surely be demolished I am a Kings son and the son of a Kings son shuddered Tandy gritting his teeth and waiting desperately for the order to fire I can bear anything Not this Not this chattered Roger sliding wildly up and down the shiny cannon It will shiver your timbers C4 it will shiver all of our timbers What in salt ails the Captain Why doesnt he give the order to fire and pepper these rascals before they reach us Oh oh Ohhh But the only orders that came from the Captain were for Nikobo Overboard Lassie Dive off Quick now and swim for your life bawled Samuel Salt waving both arms frantically at the hippopotamus As Nikobo with a frightened squeal let down the back rail of her pen and slid into the sea Tandy felt a quiver and jerk through the whole length of the Crescent Moon Glancing aloft he saw a strange change in the sails Where before they had been sturdy single stretches of canvas they were now great swelling balloon sails each a perfect airfilled sphere As the ship from the mountain with an angry swish catapulted down from the torrent into the sea the Crescent Moon rose buoyantly into the air allowing the enemy craft to shoot harmlessly beneath her bow What in Monday gasped Ato
