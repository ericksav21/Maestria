 wish Give me one of the Silver Pills This the Scarecrow tried to do but his padded gloves were too clumsy to clutch so small an object and he held the box toward the boy while Tip selected one of the pills and swallowed it Count cried the Scarecrow Onehalf one three five seven nine eleven counted Tip thirteen fifteen seventeen Now wish said the Tin Woodman anxiously But Just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became alarmed 227 The pill has poisoned me he gasped Oh Ooooo Ouch Murder Fire Ooh and here he rolled upon the bottom of the nest in such contortions that he frightened them all What can we do for you Speak I beg entreated the Tin Woodman tears of sympathy running down his nickel cheeks II dont know answered Tip Oh I wish Id never swallowed that pill Then at once the pain stopped and the boy rose to his feet again and found the Scarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the pepperbox Whats happened asked the boy a little ashamed of his recent exhibition Why the three pills are in the box again said the Scarecrow Of course they are the WoggleBug declared Didnt Tip wish that hed never swallowed one of them Well the wish came true and he didnt swallow one of them So of course they are all three in the box That may be but the pill gave me a dreadful pain just the same said the boy Impossible declared the Woggle LineArt Drawing 228 Bug If you have never swallowed it the pill can not have given you a pain And as your wish being granted proves you did not swallow the pill it is also plain that you suffered no pain Then it was a splendid imitation of a pain retorted Tip angrily Suppose you try the next pill yourself Weve wasted one wish already Oh no we havent protested the Scarecrow Here are still three pills in the box and each pill is good for a wish Now youre making my head ache said Tip I cant understand the thing at all But I wont take another pill I promise you and with this remark he retired sulkily to the back of the nest Well said the WoggleBug it remains for me to save us in my most Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated manner for I seem to be the only one able and willing to make a wish Let me have one of the pills He swallowed it without hesitation and they all stood admiring his courage while the Insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that Tip had done And for some reasonperhaps because WoggleBugs have stronger stomachs than boysthe silver pellet caused it no pain whatever I wish the Gumps broken wings mended and 229 as good as new said the WoggleBug in a slow impressive voice All turned to look at the Thing and so quickly had the wish been granted that the Gump lay before them in perfect repair and as well able to fly through the air as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the palace LineArt Drawing 230 Full page lineart drawing 231 The Scarecrow Appeals to Glinda the Good Hooray shouted the Scarecrow gaily We can now leave this miserable Jackdaws nest whenever we please But it is nearly dark said the Tin Woodman and unless we wait until morning to make our flight we may get into more trouble I dont like these night trips for one never knows what will happen So it was decided to wait until daylight and the adventurers amused themselves in the twilight by searching the Jackdaws nest for treasures The WoggleBug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold which fitted his slender arms very well The Scarecrow took a fancy for rings of which there were many in the nest Before long he 232 had fitted a ring to each finger of his padded gloves and not being content with that display he added one more to each thumb As he carefully chose those rings set with sparkling stones such as rubies amethysts and sapphires the Scarecrows hands now presented a most brilliant appearance This nest would be a picnic for Queen Jinjur said he musingly for as nearly as I can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to rob my city of its emeralds The Tin Woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to accept any additional decorations but Tip secured a fine gold watch which was attached to a heavy fob and placed it in his pocket with much pride He also pinned several jeweled brooches to Jack Pumpkinheads red waistcoat and attached a lorgnette by means of a fine chain to the neck of the SawHorse Its very pretty said the creature regarding the lorgnette approvingly but what is it for None of them could answer that question however so the SawHorse decided it was some rare decoration and became very fond of it That none of the party might be slighted they ended by placing several large seal rings upon the points of the Gumps antlers although that odd 233 personage seemed by no means gratified by the attention Darkness soon fell upon them and Tip and the WoggleBug went to sleep while the others sat down to wait patiently for the day Next morning they had cause to congratulate themselves upon the useful condition of the Gump for with daylight a great fl
