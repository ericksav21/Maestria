 ever letting you into the Throne Room Usually I will not see even my subjects and so they believe I am something terrible But I dont understand said Dorothy in bewilderment How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head That was one of my tricks answered Oz Step this way please and I will tell you all about it He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room and they all followed him He pointed to one corner in which lay the great Head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted face This I hung from the ceiling by a wire said Oz I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open But how about the voice she inquired Oh I am a ventriloquist said the little man I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish so that you thought it was coming out of the Head Here are the other things I used to deceive you He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out As for the Ball of Fire the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling It was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely Really said the Scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug I amI certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing I could do Sit down please there are plenty of chairs and I will tell you my story So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale I was born in Omaha Why that isnt very far from Kansas cried Dorothy No but its farther from here he said shaking his head at her sadly When I grew up I became a ventriloquist and at that I was very well trained by a great master I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was After a time continued Oz I tired of that and became a balloonist What is that asked Dorothy A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus he explained Oh she said I know Well one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that I couldnt come down again It went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away For a day and a night I traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country It came down gradually and I was not hurt a bit But I found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought I was a great Wizard Of course I let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything I wished them to Just to amuse myself and keep the good people busy I ordered them to build this City and my Palace and they did it all willingly and well Then I thought as the country was so green and beautiful I would call it the Emerald City and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green But isnt everything here green asked Dorothy No more than in any other city replied Oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you The Emerald City was built a great many years ago for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here and I am a very old man now But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy I have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this Palace was built I have shut myself up and would not see any of them One of my greatest fears was the Witches for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things There were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West Fortunately the Witches of the North and South were good and I knew they would do me no harm but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me As it was I lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East When you came to me I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch but now that you have melted her I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises I think you are a very bad man said Dorothy Oh no my dear Im really a very good man but Im a very bad Wizard I must admit Cant you give me brains asked the Scarecrow You dont need them You are learning something every day A baby has brains but
