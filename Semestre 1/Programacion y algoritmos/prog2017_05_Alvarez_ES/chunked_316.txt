 deck Oh my stars Oh my spars Oh my beams andFF20C4 Tandy never heard Atos last anguished cry for at that moment a savage shake of the Narwhals head sent him flying into the sea Coming up coughing and choking Tandy instinctively began to swim and for the first time became aware of the creeping vine he still had clutched in one hand And in that instant and in that whirl of danger disaster and destruction the little boy suddenly grew calm and purposeful This vine C4 Well why would this powerful vine from Patrippany Island not work as well under water as on land The chances were that it would Swimming boldly back to the ship Tandy took a quick dive hurling the vine pot and all in the general direction of the Narwhal No sooner had the vine touched the water than it began to open creep and grow and spraying out a hundred strong tentacles it seized and bound the plunging monster in a secure and inescap able cradle of leafy wood Gasping and sputtering but with his heart pounding with joy to think he had really saved Samuels beautiful ship Tandy rose to the surface Nikobo letting off shrill blasts of anger and fright came paddling anxiously toward him But giving the hippopotamus a reassuring wave Tandy seized the end of a rope ladder and pulled himself up to the deck Samuel though battered and bruised still clung to the wheel and Ato almost pounded to a jelly had rolled into the scuppers where Roger was fanning him vigorously with a butter paddle The Read Bird having wings could have left the ship at any time but had clung bravely to his post preferring to go down with the ship and his shipmates Now all three of them stared in dazed silence at Tandy as he climbed back over the rail for in the terrible confusion and excitement no one had seen him go overboard Tandy Tandy Whereve you been With outstretched arms Samuel Salt rushed groggily forward Shiver my liver Whys everything so quiet Could it be that you singlehandedly have destroyed that shipshaking menace I dont think hes destroyed Master Salt answered Tandy limping happily to meet the Captain but hes caught fast as a lobster in a lobster pot and cant move at all Caught rasped Samuel running across the deck to peer over the rail By the creeping vine explained Tandy and in short breathless sentences he told them all that had happened after he was flung into the sea Well bagpipe my mizzenmain sails gasped Samuel Salt staring at Tandy with round eyes This is the strangest and happiest day of my life Youve saved the ship and the whole expedition my boy and all we have to do now is cut loose from this cavorting unicorn of the sea and sail off with the largest ivory horn in captivity An ivory mast blast my buckles Wait till the Ozites see us sailing up the Winkie River with four masts instead of three Ahoy below Ahoy Kobo Can you dive with me beneath this ship Dive and stay under as long as you can vowed the hippopotamus shaking the water out of her eyes and looking cheerily up at the Captain You see I was right about those creeping vines now wasnt I Nikobo having done a little investigating on her own account was well nigh ready to burst with pride at Tandys quick action and the way in which the vines had overcome their gigantic foe RIGHT boomed Samuel Salt hurrying off for his oxygen helmet and powerful diamondtoothed saw Ato was too bruised and exhausted to rise but Tandy and Roger perching on the ships rail watched Samuel in his queer divers helmet climb down the rope ladder and clamber up on the hippopotamus Next minute Nikobo had disappeared under the surface and presently from the slight shiver and shake of the boat they knew that Samuel was determinedly at work cutting them loose Fortunately there was room between the ships bottom and the whales head for Nikobo to swim about and so splintering sharp was Samuels saw that in less than five minutes he had cut off the great column of ivory level with the ships bottom carefully caulking the edges with material he had brought down In its tight and live wood crate the Narwhal could not stir an inch and while the cutting of its horn was not painful it blubbered and spouted so terrifically that Samuel and Nikobo heaved tremendous sighs of relief when the dangerous operation was accomplished Backing off a few paces Nikobo began butting the crated sea beast with her head till she had driven it out from beneath the boat Roger and Tandy with little shrieks of wonder and excitement saw the crated fish like some queer and monstrous mummy rise to the surface and go floating sullenly away toward the east Now that they had a full view of the Narwhal they saw that it was three times the length of the Crescent Moon A great wonder Sammy didnt tie it to the ship and tow it along sighed Ato who had at last got to his feet and draped himself weakly over the rail Some fishin eh Mates But look at the beautiful mast we have cried Tandy waving to Nikobo and the Captain as they came cheerfully alongside Huh Youre as bad as Sammy grunted A
