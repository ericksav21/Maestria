the fire Then lighting his one poor lamp he sat sullenly down to wait for his supper The fish heads he flung cruelly into the hot ashes and whenever he dozed for a moment Nina tried to pull one out with her paw for she knew full well she would get nothing else to eat For perhaps an hour there was not a sound in the fishermans hut except the crackling of the driftwood in the grate and the hoarse breathing of the fisherman himself Then suddenly Nina who had almost succeeded in dragging her supper from the flames gave a frightened backward leap Oh my mercy me Mercy me came a muffled but merry voice Where but where am I now As Nina and her master turned startled eyes toward the red jug C4 for the voice was undoubtedly coming from the jug C4 the lid slowly lifted and a round jolly face peered out at them What he saw was so discouraging Jinnicky C4 for of course it was Jinnicky C4 dropped back out of sight The magic fluid with which he had sealed himself in the jug before Gludwig hurled him into the sea had been melted by the warmth of the fishermans fire and the same warmth had restored the little Red Jinn to his usual vigor and liveliness In a sort of protective stupor he had managed to survive the long months at the bottom of the ocean A quick thinker at all times Jinnicky rapidly regained his senses and realized at once what had happened A fortunate tide had carried him into this fishermans net and at last he was on dry land again and NOW to find and face the villain who had usurped his throne and castle But why whyC4 groaned the little Jinn dolefully C4 with all the fishermen in the Nonestic Ocean did I have to be pulled out by this longjawed fellow Venturing another look and at the same time thrusting his arms and legs out of their proper apertures in the jug he saw that Bloff had seized an oar and seemed about ready to whack it down on his head Non non NON My good fellow puffed Jinnicky fixing his rescuer with his bright glassy eye Put up your oar This is no battle and I have much to say that will interest you but first of all I want to thank you for pulling me out of the ocean Heartily Heartily A suitable reward will be sent you as soon as I get back C4 er C4 get back my castle To this polite speech Bloff paid no attention whatsoever but Nina liking the pleasant voice of this curious visitor began rubbing herself against his ankles I am the Red Jinn of Ev announced the little Wizard keeping a wary eye on the oar At present banished from my castle by the treachery of a trusted officer In fact Jinnicky tapped himself smartly on the jar this villain actually took everything I had and tossed me into the sea Whats wrong with the sea inquired the fisherman hoarsely Never having seen anyone in his whole life but the eight other Nonagon Islanders Bloff did not really believe what he saw now Im asleep and having a nightmare he concluded grasping the oar more determinedly still And we can hardly blame him for a fellow whose body is a huge red vase into which he can draw his arms legs and head at will is pretty hard for anyone to believe Realizing he was getting nowhere and that his grim and dour rescuer cared nothing about his troubles past or present Jinnicky decided to try another line Perhaps you could tell me the name of this place and your own name he murmured politely I am Bloff my cat is Nina and this is the Nonagon Island announced the fisherman frowning at the little Wizard Ah a ninesided island The Red Jinn stretched his arms and hopped up and down to get the kinks out of his legs And I see you have a ninesided cottage and a cat with nine lives Picking up poor skinny Nina who was purring for the first time in her life Jinnicky stroked her back thoughtfully as he counted the nine pieces of furniture in the rude hut noted that it was nine oclock and the ninth of May But is NINE my lucky number he pondered wearily Could this churlish fisherman ever be persuaded to sail him back to the mainland Looking at Bloff out of the side of his eye he very much doubted it Though Bloff had put down the oar his manner was anything but cordial Are there any other people on the island asked Jinnicky more to keep up the conversation that because he really wanted to know At his question Bloff put back his head and in a long singsong voice drawled Bluff Bliff Bleef Blaff Bloof Blaaf Bleof and Bluof Oh my Mercy me At each name Jinnicky gave a little jump and as Bloff came to the end of the list he seated himself gingerly on the edge of the bench and stared into the fire What could he hope from such people Then suddenly in the midst of his worries he became aware of the fish chowder bubbling cozily on the crane and realized at the same instant his enormous and devouring hunger After all you know he had not eaten for seven months Ah he beamed extending both arms toward his host DINNER MY dinner The two words were spoken so gruffly Jinnickys heart fell with a loud clunk into his boots Why this was unbelievable He Jinnicky the one
