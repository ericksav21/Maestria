k command the Gump alighted safely in this very courtyard and before Jinjur had time to do more than scream the Captain and three soldiers 281 leaped out and made the former Queen a prisoner locking strong chains upon both her wrists That act really ended the war for the Army of Revolt submitted as soon as they knew Jinjur to be a captive and the Captain marched in safety through the streets and up to the gates of the city which she threw wide open Then the bands played their most stirring music while Glindas army marched into the city and heralds proclaimed the conquest of the audacious Jinjur and the accession of the beautiful Princess Ozma to the throne of her royal ancestors At once the men of the Emerald City cast off their aprons And it is said that the women were so tired eating of their husbands cooking that they LineArt Drawing 282 all hailed the conquest of Jinjur with Joy Certain it is that rushing one and all to the kitchens of their houses the good wives prepared so delicious a feast for the weary men that harmony was immediately restored in every family Ozmas first act was to oblige the Army of Revolt to return to her every emerald or other gem stolen from the public streets and buildings and so great was the number of precious stones picked from their settings by these vain girls that every one of the royal jewelers worked steadily for more than a month to replace them in their settings Meanwhile the Army of Revolt was disbanded and the girls sent home to their mothers On promise of good behavior Jinjur was likewise released Ozma made the loveliest Queen the Emerald City had ever known and although she was so young and inexperienced she ruled her people with wisdom and Justice For Glinda gave her good advice on all occasions and the WoggleBug who was appointed to the important post of Public Educator was quite helpful to Ozma when her royal duties grew perplexing The girl in her gratitude to the Gump for its services offered the creature any reward it might name 283 Then replied the Gump please take me to pieces I did not wish to be brought to life and I am greatly ashamed of my conglomerate personality Once I was a monarch of the forest as my antlers fully prove but now in my present upholstered condition of servitude I am compelled to fly through the airmy legs being of no use to me whatever Therefore I beg to be dispersed So Ozma ordered the Gump taken apart The antlered head was again hung over the mantlepiece in the hall and the sofas were untied and placed in the reception parlors The broom tail resumed its accustomed duties in the kitchen and finally the Scarecrow replaced all the clotheslines and ropes on the pegs from which he had taken them on the eventful day when the Thing was constructed You might think that was the end of the Gump and so it was as a flyingmachine But the head over the mantlepiece continued to talk whenever it took a notion to do so and it frequently startled with its abrupt questions the people who waited in the hall for an audience with the Queen The SawHorse being Ozmas personal property was tenderly cared for and often she rode the queer creature along the streets of the Emerald City She had its wooden legs shod with gold to keep them 284 from wearing out and the tinkle of these golden shoes upon the pavement always filled the Queens subjects with awe as they thought upon this evidence of her magical powers The Wonderful Wizard was never so wonderful as Queen Ozma the people said to one another in whispers for he claimed to do many things he could not do whereas our new Queen does many things no one would ever expect her to accomplish Jack Pumpkinhead remained with Ozma to the end of his days and he did not spoil as soon as he had feared although he always remained as stupid as ever The WoggleBug tried to teach him several arts and sciences but Jack was so poor a student that any attempt to educate him was soon abandoned After Glindas army had marched back home and peace was restored to the Emerald City the Tin Woodman announced his intention to return to his own Kingdom of the Winkies It isnt a very big Kingdom said he to Ozma but for that very reason it is easier to rule and I have called myself an Emperor because I am an Absolute Monarch and no one interferes in any way with my conduct of public or personal affairs When I get home I shall have a new coat of nickel plate for I have become somewhat marred and scratched lately 285 and then I shall be glad to have you pay me a visit Thank you replied Ozma Some day I may accept the invitation But what is to become of the Scarecrow I shall return with my friend the Tin Woodman said the stuffed one seriously We have decided never to be parted in the future And I have made the Scarecrow my Royal Treasurer explained the Tin Woodman For it has occurred to me that it is a good thing to have a Royal Treasurer who is made of money What do you think I think said the little Queen smiling that your friend must be the rich
