s agitated uncle they paid no attention whatever They were too busy talking over old times and the exciting days when they had journeyed all over Oz and with the help of Jinnicky the little Red Jinn saved the Royal Family of Pumperdink from the Witch of Follensby Forest Pumperdink as most of you know is in the north central part of the Gilliken Country of Oz and ruled by King Pompus and Queen Posy Their son Prince Pompadore has much to say about affairs in that Kingdom but it is to Kabumpo his Elegant Elephant that Pompus turned oftenest for counsel and comfort Given to the King by a celebrated Blue Emperor Kabumpo has proved himself so wise and sagacious Pompus depends on him for almost everything It is Kabumpo who advises His Majesty when to have his hair cut and put aside his woolen underwear when to go to the dentist when to turn in his old fourhorse chariot for a twelvehorse model when to save money when to spend it how to get on with neighboring Kings and how to get on without them In fact so heavy are the duties and responsibilities of this remarkable elephant tis a wonder even after six years he managed this visit to Randy Randys first meeting with Kabumpo had been more or less by chance Sent out disguised as a poor mountain boy to pass the seven severe tests of Kingship required of Regalian Rulers Randy had happened to come first to the Kingdom of Pumperdink and had been hailed before the King as a vagrant The Elegant Elephant taking an instant fancy to the boy had insisted that he be allowed to stay on as his own royal attendant and in this comical capacity Randys adventures had begun For scarcely had he been in the palace of Pumperdink a week before Kettywig the Kings brother and the Witch of Follensby Forest plotting to steal the crown caused the whole royal family to disappear by some strange and fiery magic Barely missing the same fate Randy and Kabumpo managed to escape On their way through the forest they met a Soothsayer who told them to seek out the Red Jinn Now no one in Oz had ever heard of this singular personage but after many delays and hairraising experiences Randy and Kabumpo finally arrived at his splendid red glass castle Jinnicky it turned out was the Wizard of Ev and a merry and strange person he was Jinnickys whole body is encased in a shiny red jar into which he can retire like a turtle at will and the little Wizards disposition is so gay and jolly everyone around him feels the same way Not only did he welcome his visitors but set off immediately to help the Royal Family of Pumperdink out of their misfortunes and enchantment Once in Pumperdink Randy with the help of the Red Jinns magic lookingglasses was able to trace the lost King and his family and release them from the witchs spell But before that and while he was traveling here and there with Kabumpo and Jinnicky the little Prince was fulfilling all the tests and conditions required by the ancient laws of Regalia of their Kings In other words he had made three true friends served a strange King saved a Queen showed bravery in battle overcome a fabulous monster disenchanted a Princess and received from a Wizard an important magic treasure And now looking back on those brave bright days he could not help thinking that earning his crown had been more fun than wearing it I wish we could do it all over again he mused as Kabumpo after recalling their visit to Nandywog the little giant tossed off the last of the cider But think where were going now gurgled Kabumpo setting down the barrel with a resounding thud If something strange or exciting does not happen on the way there or back or in Jinnickys castle itself I do not know my Oz and Evistery Cant you just see Jinnickys face when we arrive I wonder if Alibabble is still Grand Advizier and if the magic dinner bell is still working Yes Yes Whos there Kabumpo raised his voice irritably as a persistent whistling came through the keyhole Its Dawkins explained an20anxious voice from the other side of the door The Duke says as its high time His Highness was in bed Your Highness Oh be off with you Go dive in the feathers yourself His Highness is going to sleep in here on the floor Kabumpo stood so close and spoke so violently through the keyhole Dawkins was blown back against the opposite wall For a time footsteps pattered up and down the corridor then finally deciding the young King was to have his own way at last the footmen and courtiers and even Uncle Hoochafoo took themselves off But not till everything was absolutely quiet and still and everyone in the castle asleep did Kabumpo and Randy venture forth Then stepping softly as his own tremendous shadow the Elegant Elephant with the young King on his back slipped through the silent halls and deserted courtyard past the snoring sentries and keeper of the gate and on out into the foresty Highlands beyond the palace wall Here in the bright white light of a smiling moon they took the highway to the north for the castle of the Red Jinn l
