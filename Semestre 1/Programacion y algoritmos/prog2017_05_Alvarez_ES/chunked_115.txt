ugh which our travelers would be obliged to pass Of course they at once halted a safe distance away from the terrible iron mallet The magic carpet would do them no good in this case for it was only meant to protect them from any dangers upon the ground beneath their feet and not from dangers that appeared in the air above them Wow said the Cowardly Lion with a shudder It makes me dreadfully nervous to see that big hammer pounding so near my head One blow would crush me into a doormat The iron giant is a fine fellow said Tiktok and works as steadily as a clock He was made for the Nome King by Smith Tinker who made me and his duty is to keep folks from finding the underground palace Is he not a great work of art Can he think and speak as you do asked Ozma regarding the giant with wondering eyes No replied the machine he is only made to pound the road and has no thinking or speaking attachment But he pounds very well I think Too well observed the Scarecrow He is keeping us from going farther Is there no way to stop his machinery Only the Nome King who has the key can do that answered Tiktok Then said Dorothy anxiously what shall we do Excuse me for a few minutes said the Scarecrow and I will think it over He retired then to a position in the rear where he turned his painted face to the rocks and began to think Meantime the giant continued to raise his iron mallet high in the air and to strike the path terrific blows that echoed through the mountains like the roar of a cannon Each time the mallet lifted however there was a moment when the path beneath the monster was free and perhaps the Scarecrow had noticed this for when he came back to the others he said The matter is a very simple one after all We have but to run under the hammer one at a time when it is lifted and pass to the other side before it falls again It will require quick work if we escape the blow said the Tin Woodman with a shake of his head But it really seems the only thing to be done Who will make the first attempt They looked at one another hesitatingly for a moment Then the Cowardly Lion who was trembling like a leaf in the wind said to them I suppose the head of the procession must go firstand thats me But Im terribly afraid of the big hammer What will become of me asked Ozma You might rush under the hammer yourself but the chariot would surely be crushed We must leave the chariot said the Scarecrow But you two girls can ride upon the backs of the Lion and the Tiger So this was decided upon and Ozma as soon as the Lion was unfastened from the chariot at once mounted the beasts back and said she was ready Cling fast to his mane advised Dorothy I used to ride him myself and thats the way I held on So Ozma clung fast to the mane and the lion crouched in the path and eyed the swinging mallet carefully until he knew just the instant it would begin to rise in the air Then before anyone thought he was ready he made a sudden leap straight between the iron giants legs and before the mallet struck the ground again the Lion and Ozma were safe on the other side The Tiger went next Dorothy sat upon his back and locked her arms around his striped neck for he had no mane to cling to He made the leap straight and true as an arrow from a bow and ere Dorothy realized it she was out of danger and standing by Ozmas side Now came the Scarecrow on the Sawhorse and while they made the dash in safety they were within a hairs breadth of being caught by the descending hammer Tiktok walked up to the very edge of the spot the hammer struck and as it was raised for the next blow he calmly stepped forward and escaped its descent That was an idea for the Tin Woodman to follow and he also crossed in safety while the great hammer was in the air But when it came to the twentysix officers and the private their knees were so weak that they could not walk a step In battle we are wonderfully courageous said one of the generals and our foes find us very terrible to face But war is one thing and this is another When it comes to being pounded upon the head by an iron hammer and smashed into pancakes we naturally object Make a run for it urged the Scarecrow Our knees shake so that we cannot run answered a captain If we should try it we would all certainly be pounded to a jelly Well well sighed the Cowardly Lion I see friend Tiger that we must place ourselves in great danger to rescue this bold army Come with me and we will do the best we can So Ozma and Dorothy having already dismounted from their backs the Lion and the Tiger leaped back again under the awful hammer and returned with two generals clinging to their necks They repeated this daring passage twelve times when all the officers had been carried beneath the giants legs and landed safely on the further side By that time the beasts were very tired and panted so hard that their tongues hung out of their great mouths But what is to become of the private asked Ozma Oh leave him there to guard the chariot said the Lion Im tired
