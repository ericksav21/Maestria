re he is broken The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman until at last he was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever To be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all When at last he walked into Dorothys room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away As for the Lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried If we only had the Scarecrow with us again said the Tin Woodman when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened I should be quite happy We must try to find him said the girl So she called the Winkies to help her and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrows clothes It was a very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the Woodman said at once Ill chop it down and then we can get the Scarecrows clothes Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself another of the Winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axehandle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodmans axe instead of the old broken handle Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver As soon as he had spoken the Tin Woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the Scarecrows clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the Scarecrow as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him Now that they were reunited Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em and said We must go back to Oz and claim his promise Yes said the Woodman at last I shall get my heart And I shall get my brains added the Scarecrow joyfully And I shall get my courage said the Lion thoughtfully And I shall get back to Kansas cried Dorothy clapping her hands Oh let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow This they decided to do The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them goodbye The Winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West Finding they were determined to go the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds and to the Scarecrow they gave a goldheaded walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oilcan inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms ached Dorothy went to the Witchs cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the Golden Cap She tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly She did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket Then being prepared for the journey they all started for the Emerald City and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them 14 The Winged Monkeys You will remember there was no roadnot even a pathwaybetween the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City When the four travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried They knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way But at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields They kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept
