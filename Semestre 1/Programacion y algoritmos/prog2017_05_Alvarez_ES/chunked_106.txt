ame in through beautiful stainedglass windows Remain here she said What names shall I give the Princess I am Dorothy Gale of Kansas replied the child and this gentleman is a machine named Tiktok and the yellow hen is my friend Billina The little servant bowed and withdrew going through several passages and mounting two marble stairways before she came to the apartments occupied by her mistress Princess Langwideres sittingroom was paneled with great mirrors which reached from the ceiling to the floor also the ceiling was composed of mirrors and the floor was of polished silver that reflected every object upon it So when Langwidere sat in her easy chair and played soft melodies upon her mandolin her form was mirrored hundreds of times in walls and ceiling and floor and whichever way the lady turned her head she could see and admire her own features This she loved to do and just as the maid entered she was saying to herself This head with the auburn hair and hazel eyes is quite attractive I must wear it more often than I have done of late although it may not be the best of my collection You have company Your Highness announced the maid bowing low Who is it asked Langwidere yawning Dorothy Gale of Kansas Mr Tiktok and Billina answered the maid What a queer lot of names murmured the Princess beginning to be a little interested What are they like Is Dorothy Gale of Kansas pretty She might be called so the maid replied And is Mr Tiktok attractive continued the Princess That I cannot say Your Highness But he seems very bright Will Your Gracious Highness see them Oh I may as well Nanda But I am tired admiring this head and if my visitor has any claim to beauty I must take care that she does not surpass me So I will go to my cabinet and change to No 17 which I think is my best appearance Dont you Your No 17 is exceedingly beautiful answered Nanda with another bow Again the Princess yawned Then she said Help me to rise So the maid assisted her to gain her feet although Langwidere was the stronger of the two and then the Princess slowly walked across the silver floor to her cabinet leaning heavily at every step upon Nandas arm Now I must explain to you that the Princess Langwidere had thirty headsas many as there are days in the month But of course she could only wear one of them at a time because she had but one neck These heads were kept in what she called her cabinet which was a beautiful dressingroom that lay just between Langwideres sleepingchamber and the mirrored sittingroom Each head was in a separate cupboard lined with velvet The cupboards ran all around the sides of the dressingroom and had elaborately carved doors with gold numbers on the outside and jeweledframed mirrors on the inside of them When the Princess got out of her crystal bed in the morning she went to her cabinet opened one of the velvetlined cupboards and took the head it contained from its golden shelf Then by the aid of the mirror inside the open door she put on the headas neat and straight as could beand afterward called her maids to robe her for the day She always wore a simple white costume that suited all the heads For being able to change her face whenever she liked the Princess had no interest in wearing a variety of gowns as have other ladies who are compelled to wear the same face constantly Of course the thirty heads were in great variety no two formed alike but all being of exceeding loveliness There were heads with golden hair brown hair rich auburn hair and black hair but none with gray hair The heads had eyes of blue of gray of hazel of brown and of black but there were no red eyes among them and all were bright and handsome The noses were Grecian Roman retrousse and Oriental representing all types of beauty and the mouths were of assorted sizes and shapes displaying pearly teeth when the heads smiled As for dimples they appeared in cheeks and chins wherever they might be most charming and one or two heads had freckles upon the faces to contrast the better with the brilliancy of their complexions One key unlocked all the velvet cupboards containing these treasuresa curious key carved from a single bloodred rubyand this was fastened to a strong but slender chain which the Princess wore around her left wrist When Nanda had supported Langwidere to a position in front of cupboard No 17 the Princess unlocked the door with her ruby key and after handing head No 9 which she had been wearing to the maid she took No 17 from its shelf and fitted it to her neck It had black hair and dark eyes and a lovely pearlandwhite complexion and when Langwidere wore it she knew she was remarkably beautiful in appearance There was only one trouble with No 17 the temper that went with it and which was hidden somewhere under the glossy black hair was fiery harsh and haughty in the extreme and it often led the Princess to do unpleasant things which she regretted when she came to wear her other heads But she did not remember this today and went to meet her
