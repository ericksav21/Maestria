at box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West asked Dorothy There is no road answered the Guardian of the Gates No one ever wishes to go that way How then are we to find her inquired the girl That will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the Winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves Perhaps not said the Scarecrow for we mean to destroy her Oh that is different said the Guardian of the Gates No one has ever destroyed her before so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you as she has of the rest But take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her Keep to the West where the sun sets and you cannot fail to find her They thanked him and bade him goodbye and turned toward the West walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white The ribbon around Totos neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothys dress The Emerald City was soon left far behind As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West and the ground was untilled In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere So as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her They were a long distance off but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth Go to those people said the Witch and tear them to pieces Are you not going to make them your slaves asked the leader of the wolves No she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a Lion None of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces Very well said the wolf and he dashed away at full speed followed by the others It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming This is my fight said the Woodman so get behind me and I will meet them as they come He seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolfs head from its body so that it immediately died As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodmans weapon There were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow who said It was a good fight friend They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves but the Tin Woodman told her all She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off She saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country This made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow Fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid But the Scarecrow said This is my battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms And when the crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer But the King Crow said It is only a stuffed man I will peck his eyes out The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died And then another crow flew at him and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also There were forty crows and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him Then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm
