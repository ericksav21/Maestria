r at Jellias feet But see here I am not sure I can find the way back to Oz protested Nick Chopper as Strut fell into step at his side I happened upon this airosphere by the merest chance and have no idea in which direction Oz now lies Just the same I think you will take me there Strut grinned wickedly tapping Nick on the shoulder with his staff He already had sent Junnenrump to summon the army and glancing over his shoulder Nick saw a thousand young airmen strutting along behind them As they came to the shores of Half Moon Lake Hippenscop came panting and gasping into view Her Skyness the new Starina bade me give you this he puffed handing the Tin Woodman the small oil can the Wizard had given him at the party Nick had forgotten all about his oil can and without it he was likely to rust and become perfectly helpless Taking it thankfully from the messenger he hung it on a hook beneath his arm and headed reluctantly for the Oztober Nick had no intention of flying Strut to the Emerald City Even if he had to wreck the plane he would find some way to keep the greedy airman and his legions from conquering Oz Then he would return and rescue Jellia and the soldier But without a word to Strut for argument at this point would have been useless he mounted the ladder walked through the cozy cabin and seated himself in the pilots chair Strut paused on the top rung of the ladder before he entered Follow us closely men he commanded gruffly no matter how far or fast we fly Struts young warriors raised their flying staffs to show that they understood and with a few final directions the Stratovanian stepped over the sill slammed the door of the Oztober and walked rapidly forward examining everything with lively interest So this dragonbody really flies he said bending curiously over the navigators table Ho whats this I thought you told me you had no way of finding the route back Nick Chopper much more surprised than Strut picked up the tidy map that lay on top of the buttons It certainly had not been there when he left the plane but here it was now showing the complete course they had taken since leaving the Emerald City Concluding this was some of the Wizards magic Nick examined the map attentively Each turn up or down each mile east or west was charted accurately All you have to do is follow this in reverse exclaimed Strut Unaccustomed as he was to flying except by staff he was nevertheless sharp enough to realize the value of a good map when he saw one And remember now no tricks he warned sternly Land me safely in Ohs and you will be suitably rewarded But land me anywhere else and you will be completely obliterated Nick said nothing Weary of Struts threats and boasts the Woodman touched the button to inflate the Oztobers balloon and the up south and fast buttons In the whirr and splutter of their takeoff the Airlanders further remarks and directions were completely drowned out CHAPTER 9 JELLIA IN A FRIGHTFUL JAM For a long time after the departure of the Tin Woodman and of Strut and his legions Jellia sat forlornly on the Star Throne trying to stem the tears that coursed slowly down her cheeks To be stranded on this high and dangerous airosphere was bad enough but the thought of Strut flying off to destroy Ozma and steal all her treasures was more frightening still What on airth shall we do questioned Jellia with a rueful smile of the Soldier with Green Whiskers who was tramping morosely up and down the pavilion Halting in his march Wantowin shook his head dubiously That I cannot say he murmured taking off his cap and staring gloomily inside I have no standing in this country at all But you Jellia are a Starina Therefore you must decide what is to be done And whatever your Majestys orders may be I will carry them out to the letter To the letter declared Wantowin standing up very straight and tall Oh bother my Majesty scolded Jellia You know perfectly well I didnt ask to be a Starina of this terrible place It is not what you want but what you are that counts insisted the Soldier stubbornly And theres no getting around it Jellia you are a Starina So while you are deciding what is to be done Ill just do a bit of reconnoitering It might be well to know the lay of the air Wait cried Jellia as Wantowin started smartly down the steps Whatever you do Wanny dont run she implored earnestly You might easily run off the edge and then whered you be So do please be careful and if anything frightens you run straight back here Do you promise Nothing ever frightens me said the Soldier in an offended voice Marching sternly down the steps he was off at a doublequick without even a glance over his shoulder Feeling more alone than ever Jellia sighed and folded her hands in her lap But Wantowins words foolish as they were had done her good After all she was a Starina for the time being anyway So straightening her crown and drying her tears Jellia tried to think how she should act under such bewildering circumstances How would Ozma act for insta
