carecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit This pleased Dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit But it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman and when night came the work was not done So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City and of the good Wizard Oz who would soon send her back to her own home again 8 The Deadly Poppy Field Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City To be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land But the raft was nearly done and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water They got along quite well at first but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom This is bad said the Tin Woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West and she will enchant us and make us her slaves And then I should get no brains said the Scarecrow And I should get no courage said the Cowardly Lion And I should get no heart said the Tin Woodman And I should never get back to Kansas said Dorothy We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can the Scarecrow continued and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river Then before he could pull it out againor let gothe raft was swept away and the poor Scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river Goodbye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him Indeed the Tin Woodman began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on Dorothys apron Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy he thought Then I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where I could makebelieve scare the crows at any rate But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river I am afraid I shall never have any brains after all Down the stream the raft floated and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind Then the Lion said Something must be done to save us I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail So he sprang into the water and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore It was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodmans long pole and helped push the raft to the land They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City What shall we do now asked the Tin Woodman as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him We must get back to the road in some way said Dorothy The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the Lion So when they were rested Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them It was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow they could have been very happy They walked along as fast as they could Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out Look Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad What can we do to save him asked Dorothy The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads for they did not know So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the waters edge Who are you and where are you going asked the Stork I am Dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion and we are going to the Emerald City This isnt the
