rl and the shaggy man felt they were not quite safe there and would be glad to see the last of it But it is now evening the King reminded them and you must stay with us until morning anyhow Therefore I invite you to be my guests at dinner and to attend the theater afterward and sit in the royal box Tomorrow morning if you really insist upon it you may resume your journey They consented to this and some of the foxservants led them to a suite of lovely rooms in the big palace ButtonBright was afraid to be left alone so Dorothy took him into her own room While a maidfox dressed the little girls hairwhich was a bit tangledand put some bright fresh ribbons in it another maidfox combed the hair on poor ButtonBrights face and head and brushed it carefully tying a pink bow to each of his pointed ears The maids wanted to dress the children in fine costumes of woven feathers such as all the foxes wore but neither of them consented to that A sailor suit and a fox head do not go well together said one of the maids for no fox was ever a sailor that I can remember Im not a fox cried ButtonBright Alas no agreed the maid But youve got a lovely fox head on your skinny shoulders and thats ALMOST as good as being a fox The boy reminded of his misfortune began to cry again Dorothy petted and comforted him and promised to find some way to restore him his own head If we can manage to get to Ozma she said the Princess will change you back to yourself in half a second so you just wear that fox head as comftbly as you can dear and dont worry about it at all It isnt nearly as pretty as your own head no matter what the foxes say but you can get along with it for a little while longer cant you Dont know said ButtonBright doubtfully but he didnt cry any more after that Dorothy let the maids pin ribbons to her shoulders after which they were ready for the Kings dinner When they met the shaggy man in the splendid drawing room of the palace they found him just the same as before He had refused to give up his shaggy clothes for new ones because if he did that he would no longer be the shaggy man he said and he might have to get acquainted with himself all over again He told Dorothy he had brushed his shaggy hair and whiskers but she thought he must have brushed them the wrong way for they were quite as shaggy as before As for the company of foxes assembled to dine with the strangers they were most beautifully costumed and their rich dresses made Dorothys simple gown and ButtonBrights sailor suit and the shaggy mans shaggy clothes look commonplace But they treated their guests with great respect and the Kings dinner was a very good dinner indeed Foxes as you know are fond of chicken and other fowl so they served chicken soup and roasted turkey and stewed duck and fried grouse and broiled quail and goose pie and as the cooking was excellent the Kings guests enjoyed the meal and ate heartily of the various dishes The party went to the theater where they saw a play acted by foxes dressed in costumes of brilliantly colored feathers The play was about a foxgirl who was stolen by some wicked wolves and carried to their cave and just as they were about to kill her and eat her a company of foxsoldiers marched up saved the girl and put all the wicked wolves to death How do you like it the King asked Dorothy Pretty well she answered It reminds me of one of Mr Aesops fables Dont mention Aesop to me I beg of you exclaimed King Dox I hate that mans name He wrote a good deal about foxes but always made them out cruel and wicked whereas we are gentle and kind as you may see But his fables showed you to be wise and clever and more shrewd than other animals said the shaggy man thoughtfully So we are There is no question about our knowing more than men do replied the King proudly But we employ our wisdom to do good instead of harm so that horrid Aesop did not know what he was talking about They did not like to contradict him because they felt he ought to know the nature of foxes better than men did so they sat still and watched the play and ButtonBright became so interested that for the time he forgot he wore a fox head Afterward they went back to the palace and slept in soft beds stuffed with feathers for the foxes raised many fowl for food and used their feathers for clothing and to sleep upon Dorothy wondered why the animals living in Foxville did not wear just their own hairy skins as wild foxes do when she mentioned it to King Dox he said they clothed themselves because they were civilized But you were born without clothes she observed and you dont seem to me to need them So were human beings born without clothes he replied and until they became civilized they wore only their natural skins But to become civilized means to dress as elaborately and prettily as possible and to make a show of your clothes so your neighbors will envy you and for that reason both civilized foxes and civilized humans spend most of their time dressing themselves I dont declared
