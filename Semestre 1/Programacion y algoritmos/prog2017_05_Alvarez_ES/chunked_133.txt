l Omby Amby answered the private Then Omby Amby said she I promote you to be Captain General of all the armies of my kingdom and especially to be Commander of my Body Guard at the royal palace It is very expensive to hold so many offices said the private hesitating I have no money with which to buy uniforms You shall be supplied from the royal treasury said Ozma Then the private was given a seat at the table where the other officers welcomed him cordially and the feasting and merriment were resumed Suddenly Jellia Jamb exclaimed There is nothing more to eat The Hungry Tiger has consumed everything But that is not the worst of it declared the Tiger mournfully Somewhere or somehow Ive actually lost my appetite 21 Dorothys Magic Belt Dorothy passed several very happy weeks in the Land of Oz as the guest of the royal Ozma who delighted to please and interest the little Kansas girl Many new acquaintances were formed and many old ones renewed and wherever she went Dorothy found herself among friends One day however as she sat in Ozmas private room she noticed hanging upon the wall a picture which constantly changed in appearance at one time showing a meadow and at another time a forest a lake or a village How curious she exclaimed after watching the shifting scenes for a few moments Yes said Ozma that is really a wonderful invention in magic If I wish to see any part of the world or any person living I need only express the wish and it is shown in the picture May I use it asked Dorothy eagerly Of course my dear Then Id like to see the old Kansas farm and Aunt Em said the girl Instantly the well remembered farmhouse appeared in the picture and Aunt Em could be seen quite plainly She was engaged in washing dishes by the kitchen window and seemed quite well and contented The hired men and the teams were in the harvest fields behind the house and the corn and wheat seemed to the child to be in prime condition On the side porch Dorothys pet dog Toto was lying fast asleep in the sun and to her surprise old Speckles was running around with a brood of twelve new chickens trailing after her Everything seems all right at home said Dorothy with a sigh of relief Now I wonder what Uncle Henry is doing The scene in the picture at once shifted to Australia where in a pleasant room in Sydney Uncle Henry was seated in an easy chair solemnly smoking his briar pipe He looked sad and lonely and his hair was now quite white and his hands and face thin and wasted Oh cried Dorothy in an anxious voice Im sure Uncle Henry isnt getting any better and its because he is worried about me Ozma dear I must go to him at once How can you asked Ozma I dont know replied Dorothy but let us go to Glinda the Good Im sure she will help me and advise me how to get to Uncle Henry Ozma readily agreed to this plan and caused the Sawhorse to be harnessed to a pretty green and pink phaeton and the two girls rode away to visit the famous sorceress Glinda received them graciously and listened to Dorothys story with attention I have the magic belt you know said the little girl If I buckled it around my waist and commanded it to take me to Uncle Henry wouldnt it do it I think so replied Glinda with a smile And then continued Dorothy if I ever wanted to come back here again the belt would bring me In that you are wrong said the sorceress The belt has magical powers only while it is in some fairy country such as the Land of Oz or the Land of Ev Indeed my little friend were you to wear it and wish yourself in Australia with your uncle the wish would doubtless be fulfilled because it was made in fairyland But you would not find the magic belt around you when you arrived at your destination What would become of it asked the girl It would be lost as were your silver shoes when you visited Oz before and no one would ever see it again It seems too bad to destroy the use of the magic belt in that way doesnt it Then said Dorothy after a moments thought I will give the magic belt to Ozma for she can use it in her own country And she can wish me transported to Uncle Henry without losing the belt That is a wise plan replied Glinda So they rode back to the Emerald City and on the way it was arranged that every Saturday morning Ozma would look at Dorothy in her magic picture wherever the little girl might chance to be And if she saw Dorothy make a certain signal then Ozma would know that the little Kansas girl wanted to revisit the Land of Oz and by means of the Nome Kings magic belt would wish that she might instantly return This having been agreed upon Dorothy bade goodbye to all her friends Tiktok wanted to go to Australia too but Dorothy knew that the machine man would never do for a servant in a civilized country and the chances were that his machinery wouldnt work at all So she left him in Ozmas care Billina on the contrary preferred the Land of Oz to any other country and refused to accompany Dorothy The bugs and ants that I find here are the finest flavored in the wor
