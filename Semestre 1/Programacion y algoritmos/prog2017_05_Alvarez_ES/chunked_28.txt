loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise At last however she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish When he grew to manhood Quelala as he was called was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelettes palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner One day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water Swim out my fine fellow cried my grandfather and see if the water has spotted your clothes Quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune He laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river The princess was angry and she knew of course who did it She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala and dropped in the river But my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and Quelala said a kind word for them also so that Gayelette finally spared them on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap whosoever he may be And what became of them asked Dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap replied the Monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us As his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West who made us enslave the Winkies and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West Now the Golden Cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the Emerald City before them She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys but was glad the journey was over The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City the King bowed low to Dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band That was a good ride said the little girl Yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the Lion How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap 15 The Discovery of Oz the Terrible The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell After ringing several times it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before What are you back again he asked in surprise Do you not see us answered the Scarecrow But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West We did visit her said the Scarecrow And she let you go again asked the man in wonder She could not help it for she is melted explained the Scarecrow Melted Well that is good news indeed said the man Who melted her It was Dorothy said the Lion gravely Good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once
