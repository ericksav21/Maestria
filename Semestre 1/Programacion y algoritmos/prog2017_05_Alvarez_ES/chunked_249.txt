esome but except for his jingles a more cheerful loyal little fellow could not be found in the length or breadth of the country Raised and bred by the Red Jinn he had been given to the Duke of Dork The Duke had given him to the Philadelphia boy Peter who in the course of a voyage with Samuel Salt the Pirate had captured the Dukes splendid castle boat The capture had been quite a social and friendly affair and the Duke had traded Pigasus for a Bananny Goat Peter had later brought the flying pig to the Emerald City where he was petted and admired by the whole court Now slanting down into a quiet grove Pigasus came to a gentle stop and Dorothy tumbled off his back Oh Pigasus isnt it lucky you were in the Emerald City Nobody else can remember Ozma or the others at all And I only remembered them because you sat on my back confessed the pig twitching his nose thoughtfully It was my thoughtreading gift that did the trick and I am more than ever convinced that we are under some mischievous spell or enchantment What I dont understand my dear is how you yourself escaped or chanced to remember things as they were You know before I came out here it seemed perfectly right and natural for that roly poly pudding of an Emperor to be sitting at the head of the table I knew no more about Ozma or Glinda or my former master Jinnicky than a newborn baby By the way Jinnickys gone too isnt he Yes Dorothy shook her head sorrowfully and without him or the Wizard to help well have a hard time I guess What shall we do first Piggins How about having a try at some of the Wizards magic proposed the pink pig daringly Then we might look in Ozmas magic picture and ask it to show us where all of our missing friends are now Now why didnt I think of that myself cried Dorothy and springing up she started off on a run Wait Wait grunted Pigasus pattering breathlessly after her Remember we must be very careful my dear No questions about Ozma no remarks that will arouse the anger of this scalawag Emperor or well both be clapped in a dungeon We must pretend that we have forgotten too and get away quietly later tonight This seemed so sensible a plan Dorothy readily agreed to it and without attracting any attention at all they reentered the palace and hurried immediately to Ozmas small sitting room But if they expected the magic picture to solve their problem they were soon doomed to disappointment The picture was gone from its accustomed place and the safe where Ozma kept her magic treasures and other valuables was wide open and quite empty A quick search of the Wizards laboratory proved equally discouraging The Wizards famous black bag was nowhere in sight the little hanging closet where he stored his transformation powders and wishing pills was bare as the cupboard of old Mother Hubbard Whoever planned this thought of everything wheezed Pigasus sitting heavily back on his haunches There is nothing here for us Dorothy If I were you Id get a few things together and well leave right away before anyone misses you From the cheers shouts and hilarious singing coming from the banquet hall it seemed probably that the celebration would go on for hours No one in that gay and foolish company even thought of or missed the little girl and the pink pig stealing so quietly through the dim halls of the palace Ozmas palace reflected Dorothy looking resentfully over her shoulder but now it seemed strange alien and completely unfriendly With a little shiver Dorothy drew her cloak more closely about her and stepped resolutely out into the night Pigasus pattered on ahead snorting a bit from sheer nervousness Maybe wed better fly he grunted uneasily as Dorothy caught up with him Its safer and its faster and the faster we get away from here the better Im thinking Ive been thinking too answered Dorothy in a low voice perhaps only the people in the Emerald City are under this forgetting spell Pigasus perhaps if we fly to the Winkie Country the Winkies will remember their Emperor the Tin Woodman and will help us raise an army so we can come back conquer this old Skamperoo and make him tell where he has hidden all the proper rulers of Oz and the other celebrities Thats the talk Thats the talk approved the pig twinkling his little blue eyes joyfully Up with you up with you my girl but remember if you grow sleepy let me know at once so I can descend If you fall asleep you might fall off my back and think how Id feel then Think how Id feel laughed Dorothy her spirits lifting a little at the pink pigs comical conversation and enthusiastic seconding of her plans Seating herself carefully on his plump back she quickly gave the signal to start Then up soared Pigasus over the palace gardens over the City Walls and away toward the East and the Yellow Lands of the Winkies Oh I believe everything is going to be all right thought Dorothy settling herself cozily between his wings So do I sniffed the pink pig peering mischievously over his shoulder I forgot you could read all the thought
