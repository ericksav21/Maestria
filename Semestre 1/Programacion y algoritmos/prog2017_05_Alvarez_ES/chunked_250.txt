s Goodness Gracious Of those on your back Do you mind it Pigasus Now when theyre nice thoughts like yours puffed the little pig in answer to Dorothys surprised rhyme and winking his eye jovially he zoomed like a pink Zeppelin through the sky CHAPTER 9 THE JOURNEY BEGINS For several hours Pigasus flew without slackening his pace Then as several suspicious little yawns and sighs floated past his keen upstanding ears he solemnly slanted downward If he had chosen it on purpose he could not have found a more comfortable place for Dorothy to spend the night They had already crossed the border and penetrated far into the Land of the Winkies and were now landing in the quiet garden of a prosperous Winkie farmer Set in the center of a dancing bed of yellow daffodils and tulips stood a small summerhouse and with Dorothy rubbing her eyes sleepily Pigasus trotted briskly into the rustic cottage The door was invitingly open and the moon lit up its cozy oneroomed interior Snorting with satisfaction Pigasus pattered over to a broad couch piled high with yellow cushions and rolling drowsily from his back Dorothy burrowed contentedly into the center of them falling asleep before the pig reached his own bed a soft woolly rug on the hearth Pigasus slept lightly but well and waking around six began to gaze rather anxiously at the round yellow farm buildings just visible from the door The pink pig had had several unfortunate experiences with farmers They had a way of looking at his plump body that seemed to reduce him at once to slices of bacon and sides of ham One enterprising fellow had actually caught him and shut him up in an untidy pen From this foolish prison Pigasus had escaped by spreading his wings and flying away but the mere mention of farmer gave him the shivers So now moving impatiently about the little room he waited for Dorothy to awaken and as she continued to slumber on he flew up over the mantel and swept a large yellow jug to the floor with his wing The crash of the falling jar aroused Dorothy at once and without stopping to explain Pigasus suggested that they start off and Dorothy not even noticing the broken jug readily consented Well probably find a much better place to have breakfast as we fly along murmured Pigasus as Dorothy seated herself between his wings holding her small basket of supplies in her lap Would it do any harm to stop at the farm And enquire about Ozma and spread the alarm asked Dorothy who had rather counted on a cheerful breakfast at the farmhouse No it wouldnt do any harm answered Pigasus rising in a straight line from the tulip bed and winging rapidly over the yellow fields and fences but neither would it do any good Farmers never know whats happening or going to happen I tell you though well ask the first person we meet Who would we meet in the air but a bird Now really Pigasus thats simply absurd Some of the smartest people I know are birds insisted the pig stoutly Take Roger for instance He knows more than most of have forgotten But look A brook a quiet wood Stop Listen Look For I crave food Making a swift downward curve Pigasus landed cleverly by a rippling stream edged by some tall butternut trees There were yellow raspberries along the bank and the berries with some of the sandwiches Dorothy had brought with her washed down by cool water from the brook made a splendid breakfast I wonder whether theyll have the tableaux and pageant without me sighed Dorothy biting slowly into a sardine sandwich and how they manage the circus without you Piggins or the picnic supper without Ozma or the magic and fireworks without the Wizard Theyve probably forgotten all about todays doings mumbled Pigasus nosing busily among the leaves for ripe butternuts Theyll probably spend the time bumping their noses on the floor when that fat Emperor comes waddling through the palace and bending the right knee every time his white horse sneezes or coughs Pah Choking with indignation Pigasus began gobbling up so many butternuts Dorothy feared he would never be able to fly or walk again Lets stay on the ground for a while she proposed eyeing him rather nervously as she packed the remaining sandwiches neatly back in the basket I believe theres a path beyond those trees Maybe it leads to a town or village where we may meet someone who can tell us what we want to know You dont expect to find out where Ozma and the others are hidden straight off do you Rubbing his back lazily against one of the butternut trees Pigasus looked quizzically at his earnest little companion No I dont really expect that said Dorothy slipping the basket over her arm but it would be pretty nice if we met somebody who even remembered them after all weve been through I can hardly remember them myself unless you are sitting on my back admitted the pink pig trotting soberly along at her side This Emperors magic must be strong medicine Hello Here comes a fisherman Pigasus pricked up both ears and his wings Shall I question him or will you Witho
