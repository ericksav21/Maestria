othy will soon be free and then shell attend to your works But it must be a great misfortune not to be alive Im sorry for you Why asked Tiktok Because you have no brains as I have said the Scarecrow Oh yes I have returned Tiktok I am fitted with Smith Tinkers Improved Combination Steel Brains They are what make me think What sort of brains are you fitted with I dont know admitted the Scarecrow They were given to me by the great Wizard of Oz and I didnt get a chance to examine them before he put them in But they work splendidly and my conscience is very active Have you a conscience No said Tiktok And no heart I suppose added the Tin Woodman who had been listening with interest to this conversation No said Tiktok Then continued the Tin Woodman I regret to say that you are greatly inferior to my friend the Scarecrow and to myself For we are both alive and he has brains which do not need to be wound up while I have an excellent heart that is continually beating in my bosom I congratulate you replied Tiktok I cannot help being your inferior for I am a mere machine When I am wound up I do my duty by going just as my machinery is made to go You have no idea how full of machinery I am I can guess said the Scarecrow looking at the machine man curiously Some day Id like to take you apart and see just how you are made Do not do that I beg of you said Tiktok for you could not put me together again and my usefulness would be destroyed Oh are you useful asked the Scarecrow surprised Very said Tiktok In that case the Scarecrow kindly promised I wont fool with your interior at all For I am a poor mechanic and might mix you up Thank you said Tiktok Just then Ozma reentered the room leading Dorothy by the hand and followed closely by the Princess Langwidere 8 The Hungry Tiger The first thing Dorothy did was to rush into the embrace of the Scarecrow whose painted face beamed with delight as he pressed her form to his strawpadded bosom Then the Tin Woodman embraced hervery gently for he knew his tin arms might hurt her if he squeezed too roughly These greetings having been exchanged Dorothy took the key to Tiktok from her pocket and wound up the machine mans action so that he could bow properly when introduced to the rest of the company While doing this she told them how useful Tiktok had been to her and both the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman shook hands with the machine once more and thanked him for protecting their friend Then Dorothy asked Where is Billina I dont know said the Scarecrow Who is Billina Shes a yellow hen who is another friend of mine answered the girl anxiously I wonder what has become of her She is in the chicken house in the back yard said the Princess My drawingroom is no place for hens Without waiting to hear more Dorothy ran to get Billina and just outside the door she came upon the Cowardly Lion still hitched to the chariot beside the great Tiger The Cowardly Lion had a big bow of blue ribbon fastened to the long hair between his ears and the Tiger wore a bow of red ribbon on his tail just in front of the bushy end In an instant Dorothy was hugging the huge Lion joyfully Im SO glad to see you again she cried I am also glad to see you Dorothy said the Lion Weve had some fine adventures together havent we Yes indeed she replied How are you As cowardly as ever the beast answered in a meek voice Every little thing scares me and makes my heart beat fast But let me introduce to you a new friend of mine the Hungry Tiger Oh Are you hungry she asked turning to the other beast who was just then yawning so widely that he displayed two rows of terrible teeth and a mouth big enough to startle anyone Dreadfully hungry answered the Tiger snapping his jaws together with a fierce click Then why dont you eat something she asked Its no use said the Tiger sadly Ive tried that but I always get hungry again Why it is the same with me said Dorothy Yet I keep on eating But you eat harmless things so it doesnt matter replied the Tiger For my part Im a savage beast and have an appetite for all sorts of poor little living creatures from a chipmunk to fat babies How dreadful said Dorothy Isnt it though returned the Hungry Tiger licking his lips with his long red tongue Fat babies Dont they sound delicious But Ive never eaten any because my conscience tells me it is wrong If I had no conscience I would probably eat the babies and then get hungry again which would mean that I had sacrificed the poor babies for nothing No hungry I was born and hungry I shall die But Ill not have any cruel deeds on my conscience to be sorry for I think you are a very good tiger said Dorothy patting the huge head of the beast In that you are mistaken was the reply I am a good beast perhaps but a disgracefully bad tiger For it is the nature of tigers to be cruel and ferocious and in refusing to eat harmless living creatures I am acting as no good tiger has ever before acted That is why I left the forest and joined my friend the Cowardly Lion But the Lio
