To My Readers Its no use no use at all The children wont let me stop telling tales of the Land of Oz I know lots of other stories and I hope to tell them some time or another but just now my loving tyrants wont allow me They cry OzOz more about Oz Mr Baum and what can I do but obey their commands This is Our Bookmine and the childrens For they have flooded me with thousands of suggestions in regard to it and I have honestly tried to adopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story After the wonderful success of Ozma of Oz it is evident that Dorothy has become a firm fixture in these Oz stories The little ones all love Dorothy and as one of my small friends aptly states It isnt a real Oz story without her So here she is again as sweet and gentle and innocent as ever I hope and the heroine of another strange adventure There were many requests from my little correspondents for more about the Wizard It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the first Oz book in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself a humbug The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a balloon and they were all waiting for him to come down again So what could I do but tell what happened to the Wizard afterward You will find him in these pages just the same humbug Wizard as before There was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible to do in this present book they bade me introduce Toto Dorothys little black dog who has many friends among my readers But you will see when you begin to read the story that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy was in California and so she had to start on her adventure without him In this book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog but in the next Oz book if I am permitted to write one I intend to tell a good deal about Totos further history Princess Ozma whom I love as much as my readers do is again introduced in this story and so are several of our old friends of Oz You will also become acquainted with Jim the CabHorse the Nine Tiny Piglets and Eureka the Kitten I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved as she ought to have been but perhaps she wasnt brought up properly Dorothy found her you see and who her parents were nobody knows I believe my dears that I am the proudest storyteller that ever lived Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while I read the tender loving appealing letters that came to me in almost every mail from my little readers To have pleased you to have interested you to have won your friendship and perhaps your love through my stories is to my mind as great an achievement as to become President of the United States Indeed I would much rather be your storyteller under these conditions than to be the President So you have helped me to fulfill my lifes ambition and I am more grateful to you my dears than I can express in words I try to answer every letter of my young correspondents yet sometimes there are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get your answer But be patient friends for the answer will surely come and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of preparing these books Besides I am proud to acknowledge that the books are partly yours for your suggestions often guide me in telling the stories and I am sure they would not be half so good without your clever and thoughtful assistance L FRANK BAUM Coronado 1908 1 The Earthquake The train from Frisco was very late It should have arrived at Hugsons Siding at midnight but it was already five oclock and the gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the open shed that served for the stationhouse As it came to a stop the conductor called out in a loud voice Hugsons Siding At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the car carrying a wicker suitcase in one hand and a round birdcage covered up with newspapers in the other while a parasol was tucked under her arm The conductor helped her off the car and then the engineer started his train again so that it puffed and groaned and moved slowly away up the track The reason he was so late was because all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and trembled under him and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers So he moved the cars slowly and with caution The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared around a curve then she turned to see where she was The shed at Hugsons Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench and did not look very inviting As she peered through the soft gray light not a house of any sort was visible near the station nor was any person in sight but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away She walked toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless with its head hanging down
