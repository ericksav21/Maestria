d the angry Nome King seated in their midst Surrender cried the King in a loud voice You are my prisoners Go long answered Billina from the Scarecrows shoulder You promised me that if I guessed correctly my friends and I might depart in safety And you always keep your promises I said you might leave the palace in safety retorted the King and so you may but you cannot leave my dominions You are my prisoners and I will hurl you all into my underground dungeons where the volcanic fires glow and the molten lava flows in every direction and the air is hotter than blue blazes That will be the end of me all right said the Scarecrow sorrowfully One small blaze blue or green is enough to reduce me to an ashheap Do you surrender demanded the King Billina whispered something in the Scarecrows ear that made him smile and put his hands in his jacket pockets No returned Ozma boldly answering the King Then she said to her army Forward my brave soldiers and fight for your Ruler and yourselves unto death Pardon me Most Royal Ozma replied one of her generals but I find that I and my brother officers all suffer from heart disease and the slightest excitement might kill us If we fight we may get excited Would it not be well for us to avoid this grave danger Soldiers should not have heart disease said Ozma Private soldiers are not I believe afflicted that way declared another general twirling his moustache thoughtfully If your Royal Highness desires we will order our private to attack yonder warriors Do so replied Ozma Forwardmarch cried all the generals with one voice Forwardmarch yelled the colonels Forwardmarch shouted the majors Forwardmarch commanded the captains And at that the private leveled his spear and dashed furiously upon the foe The captain of the Nomes was so surprised by this sudden onslaught that he forgot to command his warriors to fight so that the ten men in the first row who stood in front of the privates spear fell over like so many toy soldiers The spear could not go through their steel armor however so the warriors scrambled to their feet again and by that time the private had knocked over another row of them Then the captain brought down his battleaxe with such a strong blow that the privates spear was shattered and knocked from his grasp and he was helpless to fight any longer The Nome King had left his throne and pressed through his warriors to the front ranks so he could see what was going on but as he faced Ozma and her friends the Scarecrow as if aroused to action by the valor of the private drew one of Billinas eggs from his right jacket pocket and hurled it straight at the little monarchs head It struck him squarely in his left eye where the egg smashed and scattered as eggs will and covered his face and hair and beard with its sticky contents Help help screamed the King clawing with his fingers at the egg in a struggle to remove it An egg an egg Run for your lives shouted the captain of the Nomes in a voice of horror And how they DID run The warriors fairly tumbled over one another in their efforts to escape the fatal poison of that awful egg and those who could not rush down the winding stair fell off the balcony into the great cavern beneath knocking over those who stood below them Even while the King was still yelling for help his throne room became emptied of every one of his warriors and before the monarch had managed to clear the egg away from his left eye the Scarecrow threw the second egg against his right eye where it smashed and blinded him entirely The King was unable to flee because he could not see which way to run so he stood still and howled and shouted and screamed in abject fear While this was going on Billina flew over to Dorothy and perching herself upon the Lions back the hen whispered eagerly to the girl Get his belt Get the Nome Kings jeweled belt It unbuckles in the back Quick Dorothyquick 18 The Fate of the Tin Woodman Dorothy obeyed She ran at once behind the Nome King who was still trying to free his eyes from the egg and in a twinkling she had unbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with her to her place beside the Tiger and Lion where because she did not know what else to do with it she fastened it around her own slim waist Just then the Chief Steward rushed in with a sponge and a bowl of water and began mopping away the broken eggs from his masters face In a few minutes and while all the party stood looking on the King regained the use of his eyes and the first thing he did was to glare wickedly upon the Scarecrow and exclaim Ill make you suffer for this you haystuffed dummy Dont you know eggs are poison to Nomes Really said the Scarecrow they DONT seem to agree with you although I wonder why They were strictly fresh and above suspicion said Billina You ought to be glad to get them Ill transform you all into scorpions cried the King angrily and began waving his arms and muttering magic words But none of the people became scorpions so the King stopped
