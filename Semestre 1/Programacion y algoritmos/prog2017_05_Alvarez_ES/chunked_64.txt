CARECROW 131 recapture the Emerald City and place the Scarecrow again upon his throne I was sure you would help me remarked the Scarecrow in a pleased voice How large an army can you assemble We do not need an army replied the Woodman We four with the aid of my gleaming axe are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the rebels We five corrected the Pumpkinhead Five repeated the Tin Woodman Yes the SawHorse is brave and fearless answered Jack forgetting his recent quarrel with the quadruped The Tin Woodman looked around him in a puzzled way for the SawHorse had until now remained quietly standing in a corner where the Emperor had not noticed him Tip immediately called the oddlooking creature to them and it approached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful centertable and the engraved oilcan I begin to think remarked the Tin Woodman as he looked earnestly at the SawHorse that wonders will never cease How came this creature alive I did it with a magic powder modestly asserted the boy and the Saw Horse has been very useful to us 132 He enabled us to escape the rebels added the Scarecrow Then we must surely accept him as a comrade declared the emperor A live SawHorse is a distinct novelty and should prove an interesting study Does he know anything Well I cannot claim any great experience in life the SawHorse answered for himself but I seem to learn very quickly and often it occurs to me that I know more than any of those around me Perhaps you do said the emperor for experience does not always mean wisdom But time is precious Just now so let us quickly make preparations to start upon our Journey The emperor called his Lord High Chancellor and instructed him how to run the kingdom during his absence Meanwhile the Scarecrow was taken apart and the painted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and restuffed with the brains originally given him by the great Wizard His clothes were also cleaned and pressed by the Imperial tailors and his crown polished and again sewed upon his head for the Tin Woodman insisted he should not renounce this badge of royalty The Scarecrow now presented a very respectable appearance and although in no way addicted to vanity he 133 was quite pleased with himself and strutted a trifle as he walked While this was being done Tip mended the wooden limbs of Jack Pumpkinhead and made them stronger than before and the SawHorse was also inspected to see if he was in good working order Then bright and early the next morning they set out upon the return Journey to the emerald City the Tin Woodman bearing upon his shoulder a gleaming axe and leading the way while the Pumpkinhead rode upon the SawHorse and Tip and the Scarecrow walked upon either side to make sure that he didnt fall off or become damaged LineArt Drawing 134 Full page lineart drawing 135 Mr H M WoggleBug T E Now General Jinjurwho you will remember commanded the Army of Revoltwas rendered very uneasy by the escape of the Scarecrow from the Emerald City She feared and with good reason that if his Majesty and the Tin Woodman Joined forces it would mean danger to her and her entire army for the people of Oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of these famous heroes who had passed successfully through so many startling adventures So Jinjur sent posthaste for old Mombi the witch and promised her large rewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army Mombi was furious at the trick Tip had played upon her as well as at his escape and the theft of the precious Powder of Life so she needed no urging 136 to induce her to travel to the Emerald City to assist Jinjur in defeating the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman who had made Tip one of their friends Mombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered by means of her secret magic that the adventurers were starting upon their Journey to the Emerald City so she retired to a small room high up in a tower and locked herself in while she practised such arts as she could command to prevent the return of the Scarecrow and his companions That was why the Tin Woodman presently stopped and said Something very curious has happened I ought to know by heart and every step of this Journey yet I fear we have already lost our way That is quite impossible protested the Scarecrow Why do you think my dear friend that we have gone astray Why here before us is a great field of sunflowersand I never saw this field before in all my life At these words they all looked around only to find that they were indeed surrounded by a field of tall stalks every stalk bearing at its top a gigantic sunflower And not only were these flowers almost 137 blinding in their vivid hues of red and gold but each one whirled around upon its stalk like a miniature windmill completely dazzling the vision of the beholders and so mystifying them that they knew not which way to turn Its witchcraft exclaimed Tip While they paused hesitating and wondering the Tin Woodman uttered a cry of impatienc
