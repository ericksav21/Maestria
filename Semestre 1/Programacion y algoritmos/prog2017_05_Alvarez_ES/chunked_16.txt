anding around and looking at her timidly But the Scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little Mouse he said Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty the Queen Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck using the strings they had brought One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep After a great deal of hard work for the Lion was heavy they managed to get him up on the truck Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep At first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind and they got along better Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had been rescued Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave If ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance Goodbye Goodbye they all answered and away the Queen ran while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner 10 The Guardian of the Gate It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened for he had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive I ran as fast as I could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me How did you get me out Then they told him of the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death and the Cowardly Lion laughed and said I have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life How strange it all is But comrades what shall we do now We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again said Dorothy and then we can keep on to the Emerald City So the Lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt The road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades Once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion of which they were very much afraid The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emeraldgreen color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins This must be the Land of Oz said Dorothy and we are surely getting near the Emerald City Yes answered the Scarecrow Everything is green here while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins and Im afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night I should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and Im sure Toto is nearly starved Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people So when they came to a goodsized farmhouse Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked A woman opened it just far enough to look out and said What do you want child and why is that great Lion with you We wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered Dorothy and the Lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for the world Is he tame asked the woman opening the door a little wider Oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too He will be more afraid of you than you are of
