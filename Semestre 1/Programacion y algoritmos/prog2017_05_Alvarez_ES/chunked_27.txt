 soundly until morningall but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman The next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going If we walk far enough said Dorothy I am sure we shall sometime come to some place But day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit We have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City I shall never get my brains Nor I my heart declared the Tin Woodman It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz and you must admit this is a very long journey You see said the Cowardly Lion with a whimper I havent the courage to keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all Then Dorothy lost heart She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and Toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next Suppose we call the field mice she suggested They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City To be sure they could cried the Scarecrow Why didnt we think of that before Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her Among them was the Queen herself who asked in her squeaky little voice What can I do for my friends We have lost our way said Dorothy Can you tell us where the Emerald City is Certainly answered the Queen but it is a great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time Then she noticed Dorothys Golden Cap and said Why dont you use the charm of the Cap and call the Winged Monkeys to you They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour I didnt know there was a charm answered Dorothy in surprise What is it It is written inside the Golden Cap replied the Queen of the Mice But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us Wont they hurt me asked the girl anxiously Oh no They must obey the wearer of the Cap Goodbye And she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining These she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head Eppe peppe kakke she said standing on her left foot What did you say asked the Scarecrow who did not know what she was doing Hillo hollo hello Dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot Hello replied the Tin Woodman calmly Zizzy zuzzy zik said Dorothy who was now standing on both feet This ended the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them The King bowed low before Dorothy and asked What is your command We wish to go to the Emerald City said the child and we have lost our way We will carry you replied the King and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys one of them the King himself They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap she asked That is a long story answered the King with a winged laugh but as we have a long journey before us I will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish I shall be glad to hear it she replied Once began the leader we were a free people living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest But we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day This was many years ago long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land There lived here then away at the North a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress All her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good Her name was Gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby Everyone
