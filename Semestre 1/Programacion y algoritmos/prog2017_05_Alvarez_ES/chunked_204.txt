etly until we are made into soup would be foolish and cowardly The Scoodler on guard stood near the doorway turning first his white side toward them and then his black side as if he wanted to show to all of his greedy four eyes the sight of so many fat prisoners The captives sat in a sorrowful group at the other end of the roomexcept Polychrome who danced back and forth in the little place to keep herself warm for she felt the chill of the cave Whenever she approached the shaggy man he would whisper something in her ear and Polly would nod her pretty head as if she understood The shaggy man told Dorothy and ButtonBright to stand before him while he emptied the potatoes out of one of the sacks When this had been secretly done little Polychrome dancing near to the guard suddenly reached out her hand and slapped his face the next instant whirling away from him quickly to rejoin her friends The angry Scoodler at once picked off his head and hurled it at the Rainbows Daughter but the shaggy man was expecting that and caught the head very neatly putting it in the sack which he tied at the mouth The body of the guard not having the eyes of its head to guide it ran here and there in an aimless manner and the shaggy man easily dodged it and opened the door Fortunately there was no one in the big cave at that moment so he told Dorothy and Polly to run as fast as they could for the entrance and out across the narrow bridge Ill carry ButtonBright he said for he knew the little boys legs were too short to run fast Dorothy picked up Toto and then seized Pollys hand and ran swiftly toward the entrance to the cave The shaggy man perched ButtonBright on his shoulders and ran after them They moved so quickly and their escape was so wholly unexpected that they had almost reached the bridge when one of the Scoodlers looked out of his house and saw them The creature raised a shrill cry that brought all of its fellows bounding out of the numerous doors and at once they started in chase Dorothy and Polly had reached the bridge and crossed it when the Scoodlers began throwing their heads One of the queer missiles struck the shaggy man on his back and nearly knocked him over but he was at the mouth of the cave now so he set down ButtonBright and told the boy to run across the bridge to Dorothy Then the shaggy man turned around and faced his enemies standing just outside the opening and as fast as they threw their heads at him he caught them and tossed them into the black gulf below The headless bodies of the foremost Scoodlers kept the others from running close up but they also threw their heads in an effort to stop the escaping prisoners The shaggy man caught them all and sent them whirling down into the black gulf Among them he noticed the crimson and yellow head of the Queen and this he tossed after the others with right good will Presently every Scoodler of the lot had thrown its head and every head was down in the deep gulf and now the helpless bodies of the creatures were mixed together in the cave and wriggling around in a vain attempt to discover what had become of their heads The shaggy man laughed and walked across the bridge to rejoin his companions Its lucky I learned to play baseball when I was young he remarked for I caught all those heads easily and never missed one But come along little ones the Scoodlers will never bother us or anyone else any more ButtonBright was still frightened and kept insisting I dont want to be soup for the victory had been gained so suddenly that the boy could not realize they were free and safe But the shaggy man assured him that all danger of their being made into soup was now past as the Scoodlers would be unable to eat soup for some time to come So now anxious to get away from the horrid gloomy cave as soon as possible they hastened up the hillside and regained the road just beyond the place where they had first met the Scoodlers and you may be sure they were glad to find their feet on the old familiar path again 11 Johnny Dooit Does It Its getting awful rough walking said Dorothy as they trudged along ButtonBright gave a deep sigh and said he was hungry Indeed all were hungry and thirsty too for they had eaten nothing but the apples since breakfast so their steps lagged and they grew silent and weary At last they slowly passed over the crest of a barren hill and saw before them a line of green trees with a strip of grass at their feet An agreeable fragrance was wafted toward them Our travelers hot and tired ran forward on beholding this refreshing sight and were not long in coming to the trees Here they found a spring of pure bubbling water around which the grass was full of wild strawberry plants their pretty red berries ripe and ready to eat Some of the trees bore yellow oranges and some russet pears so the hungry adventurers suddenly found themselves provided with plenty to eat and to drink They lost no time in picking the biggest strawberries and ripest oranges and soon had feasted
