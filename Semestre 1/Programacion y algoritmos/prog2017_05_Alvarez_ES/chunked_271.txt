 power But nothing at all had happened and the trick of the magic emeralds continued to elude him To have in his fingers the means to immense power and good fortune and still be unable to benefit was so infuriating Matiah began to stamp splutter and beat his chest with rage and disappointment Was it for this he had bribed a red eagle with the promise of three wishes to carry him across the Deadly Desert Even now the mammoth bird was waiting impatiently on the edge of a little wood near the City ready to tear him to pieces if he failed to fulfill his part of the bargain No daylight penetrated into the tunneled chamber and hardly realizing that it was now midnight Matiah from sheer weariness and exasperation finally gave up and fell asleep his head on the table his hands still clutching the provoking chains Footsteps pattering overhead wakened him at last and also told him someone had come to the cellar for supplies Stretching wearily he rose and going over to the stone steps cautiously ascended and lifted the trapdoor Now thoroughly convinced that the necklaces would not work unless worn by someone else he determined to seize the first person entering the cellar and compel him to help The merchant did not have long to wait All unconscious of the part he was to play in Matiahs dark schemes a young Kitchen Boy came whistling his way toward a great golden bin of potatoes The bin was just beyond the trapdoor and lowering it to a mere crack Matiah let the boy pass Then as he leaned down to fill his basket the wily merchant flung up the trapdoor fell upon the boy and carried him kicking and screaming down the stairs Here with threats promises and innumerable shakings he finally reduced the poor lad to a state of frightened submission With the sparkling necklaces round his neck he touched one and then another of the emeralds as Matiah wished and counted and counted and wished After each unsuccessful trial the merchant would rage and stamp and shake his fists till the boy was quite convinced he was in the presence and power of a madman and frantically waited for someone to overhear Matiahs ravings and come down to rescue him But nobody did While the unfortunate Kitchen Boy was spending a miserable morning in the underground chamber Skamperoo and Chalk were going through the motions of enjoying themselves above stairs but without any real zest or pleasure Only halfheartedly Skamperoo laughed at the jokes of the Scarecrow and Chalk for all his bright interest in the long recital of Kabumpos adventures was really in a fidget of uneasiness trying to keep an eye on all the doors and windows in the Throne Room at once Something was going to happen The white horse felt it in every bone And just as the soft musical gong sounded the call for luncheon his worst fears were realized Suddenly without reason or warning the castle was plunged into total darkness Thumps bumps hysterical shouts and screams followed closely on the heels of this disconcerting event Chalk who had been standing back of Skamperoo immediately leaned forward and grasped his impetuous little Master by the seat of his Royal Breeches Be still commanded the white horse through his teeth and the white leather of Skamperoos riding pants and he held on for dear life as the Emperor like all the rest of the court and guests tried to rush in every direction Hes done it Hes done it and everything is ruined wailed Skamperoo struggling in vain to pull away from Chalk Matiah has discovered the secret of the necklaces and now we are ruined Do you hear Ruined I hear hissed Chalk giving Skamperoo a little shake and so will everyone else unless you shut your mouth Be quiet I tell you do nothing till the right moment unless you want to dash out your brains against a pillar in the dark Too frightened to argue or struggle further Skamperoo at last subsided All about courtiers servants and guests were screaming and bumping into each other or the furniture and when a stern hand suddenly seized his bridle Chalk trembled violently in spite of himself Follow me directed a firm stern little voice and no harm will come to you Now Chalk had been expecting to see or hear Matiah and the sound of this small strange voice was a welcome relief and surprise Taking a firmer hold on Skamperoo he thrust out his head in an endeavor to touch or feel the newcomer As he did so the hand on his bridle began to tug him gently but firmly forward Look out there mind what you are about the Emperor of Oz is just ahead whinnied Chalk now thoroughly alarmed We are not used to taking orders from strangers Oh we wont be strangers long promised the strange voice pleasantly So THIS is the Emperor of Oz and is this the way you usually carry him Come ON Bitty Bit whats the use of all this arguing put in another voice impatiently Lets get out of this confusion The Wizards laboratory is right across the hall Tell him to come there A girl decided Chalk with another gulp of relief Maybe we are not so badly off after
