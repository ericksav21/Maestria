 expect the old woman to return home Tip went down into the valley below the farmhouse and began to gather nuts from the trees that grew there However old Mombi returned earlier than usual She had met a crooked wizard who resided in a lonely cave in the mountains and had traded several important secrets of magic with him Hav 17 ing in this way secured three new recipes four magical powders and a selection of herbs of wonderful power and potency she hobbled home as fast as she could in order to test her new sorceries So intent was Mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she turned the bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man she merely nodded and said Good evening sir But a moment after noting that the person did not move or reply she cast a shrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head elaborately carved by Tips jackknife Heh ejaculated Mombi giving a sort of grunt that rascally boy has been playing tricks again Very good very good Ill beat him black andblue for trying to scare me in this fashion Angrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of the dummy but a sudden thought made her pause the uplifted stick left motionless in the air Why here is a good chance to try my new powder said she eagerly And then I can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly traded secrets or whether he has fooled me as wickedly as I fooled him 18 So she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the precious powders she had obtained While Mombi was thus occupied Tip strolled back with his pockets full of nuts and discovered the old woman standing beside his man and apparently not the least bit frightened by it At first he was generally disappointed but the next moment he became curious to know what Mombi was going to do So he hid behind a hedge where he could see without being seen and prepared to watch After some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepperbox upon the faded label of which the wizard had written with a leadpencil Powder of Life Ahhere it is she cried joyfully And now let us see if it is potent The stingy wizard didnt give me much of it but I guess theres enough for two or three doses Tip was much surprised when he overheard this speech Then he saw old Mombi raise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the pumpkin head of his man Jack She did this in the same way one would pepper a baked potato and the powder sifted down from Jacks head and scattered 19 Full page lineart drawing OLD MOMBI DANCED AROUND HIM 20 over the red shirt and pink waistcoat and purple trousers Tip had dressed him in and a portion even fell upon the patched and worn shoes Then putting the pepperbox back into the basket Mombi lifted her left hand with its little finger pointed upward and said Weaugh Then she lifted her right hand with the thumb pointed upward and said Teaugh Then she lifted both hands with all the fingers and thumbs spread out and cried Peaugh Jack Pumpkinhead stepped back a pace at this and said in a reproachful voice Dont yell like that Do you think Im deaf Old Mombi danced around him frantic with delight He lives she screamed He lives he lives Then she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down and she hugged herself with both arms and tried to do a step of a jig and all the time she repeated rapturously He liveshe liveshe lives Now you may well suppose that Tip observed all this with amazement 21 At first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away but his legs trembled and shook so badly that he couldnt Then it struck him as a very funny thing for Jack to come to life especially as the expression on his pumpkin face was so droll and comical it excited laughter on the instant So recovering from his first fear Tip began to laugh and the merry peals reached old Mombis ears and made her hobble quickly to the hedge where she seized Tips collar and dragged him back to where she had left her basket and the pumpkinheaded man You naughty sneaking wicked boy she exclaimed furiously Ill teach you to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me I wasnt making fun of you protested Tip I was laughing at old Pumpkinhead Look at him Isnt he a picture though I hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance said Jack and it was so funny to hear his grave voice while his face continued to wear its jolly smile that Tip again burst into a peal of laughter Even Mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had brought to life for after staring at him intently she presently asked 22 Full page lineart drawing OLD MOMBI PUTS JACK IN THE STABLE 23 What do you know Well that is hard to tell replied Jack For although I feel that I know a tremendous lot I am not yet aware how much there is in the world to find out about It will take me a little time to discover whether I am very wise or very foolish To be sure said Mombi thoughtfully But what are you going to do with him now he is alive asked Tip wondering I must
