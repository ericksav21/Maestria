or the jubilation We will she promised and then they all left him and resumed their journey 17 The Royal Chariot Arrives The neat yellow houses of the Winkies were now to be seen standing here and there along the roadway giving the country a more cheerful and civilized look They were farmhouses though and set far apart for in the Land of Oz there were no towns or villages except the magnificent Emerald City in its center Hedges of evergreen or of yellow roses bordered the broad highway and the farms showed the care of their industrious inhabitants The nearer the travelers came to the great city the more prosperous the country became and they crossed many bridges over the sparkling streams and rivulets that watered the lands As they walked leisurely along the shaggy man said to the Tin Woodman What sort of a Magic Powder was it that made your friend the Pumpkinhead live It was called the Powder of Life was the answer and it was invented by a crooked Sorcerer who lived in the mountains of the North Country A Witch named Mombi got some of this powder from the crooked Sorcerer and took it home with her Ozma lived with the Witch then for it was before she became our Princess while Mombi had transformed her into the shape of a boy Well while Mombi was gone to the crooked Sorcerers the boy made this pumpkinheaded man to amuse himself and also with the hope of frightening the Witch with it when she returned But Mombi was not scared and she sprinkled the Pumpkinhead with her Magic Powder of Life to see if the Powder would work Ozma was watching and saw the Pumpkinhead come to life so that night she took the pepperbox containing the Powder and ran away with it and with Jack in search of adventures Next day they found a wooden SawHorse standing by the roadside and sprinkled it with the Powder It came to life at once and Jack Pumpkinhead rode the SawHorse to the Emerald City What became of the SawHorse afterward asked the shaggy man much interested in this story Oh its alive yet and you will probably meet it presently in the Emerald City Afterward Ozma used the last of the Powder to bring the Flying Gump to life but as soon as it had carried her away from her enemies the Gump was taken apart so it doesnt exist any more Its too bad the Powder of Life was all used up remarked the shaggy man it would be a handy thing to have around I am not so sure of that sir answered the Tin Woodman A while ago the crooked Sorcerer who invented the Magic Powder fell down a precipice and was killed All his possessions went to a relativean old woman named Dyna who lives in the Emerald City She went to the mountains where the Sorcerer had lived and brought away everything she thought of value Among them was a small bottle of the Powder of Life but of course Dyna didnt know it was a Magic Powder at all It happened she had once had a big blue bear for a pet but the bear choked to death on a fishbone one day and she loved it so dearly that Dyna made a rug of its skin leaving the head and four paws on the hide She kept the rug on the floor of her front parlor Ive seen rugs like that said the shaggy man nodding but never one made from a blue bear Well continued the Tin Woodman the old woman had an idea that the Powder in the bottle must be mothpowder because it smelled something like mothpowder so one day she sprinkled it on her bear rug to keep the moths out of it She said looking lovingly at the skin I wish my dear bear were alive again To her horror the bear rug at once came to life having been sprinkled with the Magic Powder and now this live bear rug is a great trial to her and makes her a lot of trouble Why asked the shaggy man Well it stands up on its four feet and walks all around and gets in the way and that spoils it for a rug It cant speak although it is alive for while its head might say words it has no breath in a solid body to push the words out of its mouth Its a very slimpsy affair altogether that bear rug and the old woman is sorry it came to life Every day she has to scold it and make it lie down flat on the parlor floor to be walked upon but sometimes when she goes to market the rug will hump up its back skin and stand on its four feet and trot along after her I should think Dyna would like that said Dorothy Well she doesnt because every one knows it isnt a real bear but just a hollow skin and so of no actual use in the world except for a rug answered the Tin Woodman Therefore I believe it is a good thing that all the Magic Powder of Life is now used up as it can not cause any more trouble Perhaps youre right said the shaggy man thoughtfully At noon they stopped at a farmhouse where it delighted the farmer and his wife to be able to give them a good luncheon The farm people knew Dorothy having seen her when she was in the country before and they treated the little girl with as much respect as they did the Emperor because she was a friend of the powerful Princess Ozma They had not proceeded far after leaving this farmhouse bef
