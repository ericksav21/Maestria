uder and louder and his gestures more spectacular and desperate the white horse rose up on his hind legs and shook his head in violent warning and displeasure Hush he directed in a low voice Ill be right up Making his way quickly but cautiously so as not to arouse the curiosity of any of the palace servants already at work in the lower hallways Chalk hurried up to the agitated Emperor Theyre gggone blubbered Skamperoo sitting on the edge of the bed and crying like a baby Ggggone Now everything is ruined and Ill have nothing left at all Well you still have me murmured Chalk resting his head affectionately on Skamperoos shoulder Brace up Kingaling and for oats sake be quiet No one here knows about the necklaces and until the rascal who has stolen them learns how to use them wee are as safe as soap That rascal of course is Matiah Somehow he has managed to cross the Deadly Desert Yes Chalk shook his mane wrathfully I am convinced that Matiah has the necklaces but what good are they to him when we alone know the secret that makes them work Hell have to come to us in the end and when he does Hah Chalk expelled the air from his nose in a terrific snort Just let me take care of him But shouldnt we give the alarm have a search made for him and try to recover the emeralds Let him alone counseled the wishing horse firmly The thing for you to do is to sit tight on the throne of Oz Remember you are still the Emperor But how can I be without those emeralds Skamperoo dabbed at his eyes with the satin bedsheet We got along all right yesterday said Chalk calmly Come cheer up Skamper everything will be ALL right I rather counted on beating the Scarecrow in that race this morning muttered Skamperoo wistfully How can you run as fast as that tireless wooden creature who was magically brought to life Well wasnt I magically brought to life The white horse shook his mane roguishly Come along Kingaling well not only win that race but well have back our necklaces and chase Matiah out of Oz before we are through I C4 I really believe you can do anything sighed Skamperoo getting almost cheerfully to his feet But just the same I shall keep a sharp outlook for Matiah He might start a revolution Hell revolute pretty rapidly if I once get my heels on him promised Chalk with a wicked grin Come on Heads up and whos afraid However in spite of the white horses valiant attempts to comfort him Skamperoo spent a troubled and uneasy day casting fearful glances behind him when no one was looking searching the happy holiday crowds with haggard glances for a glimpse of the long thin face of Matiah the merchant Even when Chalk beat the Sawhorse in their long exciting race through the park and the crowds cheered themselves hoarse with delight and approval the victory was spoiled by the knowledge that somewhere in the Emerald City lurked his most dangerous and relentless foe Chalk too though he pretended to regard the matter lightly was almost as worried as his Master and spent every free moment poking his head into doorways and peering down side streets and rearing up over walls And while Skamperoo was having his afternoon nap the white horse systematically searched the palace from top to bottom even the cellar But in the cellar Chalk did not go quite far enough for it was in a hollowedout chamber under the cellar that the merchant of Skampavia was really hidden Here with a goodly supply of food stolen from the pantry Matiah had seriously settled down to work out the problem of the emerald necklace He had meant to conceal himself in the cellar itself but when his foot brushed against an iron ring in the floor he had lifted it up and discovered to his delight and satisfaction this stillmoresecluded and safe retreat The tunnels and rocky chambers below the Palace had been constructed and used by Ruggedo the old Gnome King when he was plotting to capture the Emerald City Ruggedo himself had been captured but the underground caves and passageways had been left pretty much as they were There were a number of chairs a rough bed and table and numerous candles and lamps Altogether it made an ideal workshop for the merchant to try out his experiments In the cellar he might easily have been discovered by any of the kitchen boys sent down for supplies but in Ruggedos old hideout he could be sure of complete privacy Lighting the largest of the lamps that hung on its rusty chain over the table Matiah seated himself on a rickety old chair and prepared to concentrate with all his will power on the glittering emeralds In the sickly green light he made a strange and sinister figure as he bent over the table mumbling and chattering to himself But after a whole day during which he tried every known formula and combination touching each gem in succession as he made his wish and counted to a hundred he was still no nearer the solution of the mystery than he had been in Skampavia First he had tried the diamond clasp of the third necklace sure that that was the key to their
