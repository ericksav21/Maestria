scape from our difficulties I believe I will think for a few minutes so I will thank you friend Tip to get out your knife and rip this heavy crown from my forehead Tip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the Scarecrows head and the former monarch of the Emerald City removed it with a sigh of relief and hung it on a peg beside the throne That is my last memento of royalty said he and Im glad to get rid of it The former King of this City LineArt Drawing 186 who was named Pastoria lost the crown to the Wonderful Wizard who passed it on to me Now the girl Jinjur claims it and I sincerely hope it will not give her a headache A kindly thought which I greatly admire said the Tin Woodman nodding approvingly And now I will indulge in a quiet think continued the Scarecrow lying back in the throne The others remained as silent and still as possible so as not to disturb him for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the Scarecrow And after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers the thinker sat up looked upon his friends with his most whimsical expression and said My brains work beautifully today Im quite proud of them Now listen If we attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we shall surely be captured And as we cant escape through the ground there is only one other thing to be done We must escape through the air He paused to note the effect of these words but all his hearers seemed puzzled and unconvinced The Wonderful Wizard escaped in a balloon he continued We dont know how to make a balloon of course but any sort of thing that can 187 fly through the air can carry us easily So I suggest that my friend the Tin Woodman who is a skillful mechanic shall build some sort of a machine with good strong wings to carry us and our friend Tip can then bring the Thing to life with his magical powder Bravo cried Nick Chopper What splendid brains murmured Jack Really quite clever said the Educated WoggleBug I believe it can be done declared Tip that is if the Tin Woodman is equal to making the Thing Ill do my best said Nick cheerily and as a matter of fact I do not often fail in what I attempt But the Thing will have to be built on the roof of the palace so it can rise comfortably into the air LineArt Drawing 188 To be sure said the Scarecrow Then let us search through the palace continued the Tin Woodman and carry all the material we can find to the roof where I will begin my work First however said the Pumpkinhead I beg you will release me from this horse and make me another leg to walk with For in my present condition I am of no use to myself or to anyone else So the Tin Woodman knocked a mahogany centertable to pieces with his axe and fitted one of the legs which was beautifully carved on to the body of Jack Pumpkinhead who was very proud of the acquisition It seems strange said he as he watched the Tin Woodman work that my left leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of me That proves you are unusual returned the Scarecrow and I am convinced that the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the unusual ones For the common folks are like the leaves of a tree and live and die unnoticed Spoken like a philosopher cried the WoggleBug as he assisted the Tin Woodman to set Jack upon his feet How do you feel now asked Tip watching 189 the Pumpkinhead stump around to try his new leg As good as new answered Jack Joyfully and quite ready to assist you all to escape Then let us get to work said the Scarecrow in a businesslike tone So glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their captivity the friends separated to wander over the palace in search of fitting material to use in the construction of their aerial machine LineArt Drawing 190 Full page lineart drawing 191 The Astonishing Flight of the Gump When the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a remarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the various members of the party No one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was required but all had brought something The WoggleBug had taken from its position over the mantlepiece in the great hallway the head of a Gump which was adorned with widespreading antlers and this with great care and greater difficulty the insect had carried up the stairs to the roof This Gump resembled an Elks head only the nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers 192 upon its chin like those of a billygoat Why the WoggleBug selected this article he could not have explained except that it had aroused his curiosity Tip with the aid of the SawHorse had brought a large upholstered sofa to the roof It was an oldfashioned piece of furniture with high back and ends and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the back of the SawHorse the boy found himself out of breath when at last the clumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof The Pumpkinhead had brought a broom which was the first thing he saw The Sc
