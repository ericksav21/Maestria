 and beggars cup along the shining streets of the capital The mans head was clean shaven and his small cap coarse belted robe and sandals marked him as a monk of some old and ancient order He nodded gently to each person he passed and seemed in spite of his many years and wrinkles innocent and harmless as a child The splendor and magnificence of the capital astonished and bewildered the old gentleman and in a sort of stupefied disbelief he stared at the emeraldstudded streets and houses and gazed up at the lofty peaks and spires of the royal palace And this was not strange for of all the fairy cities out of the world the Emerald City of Oz is the most dazzling and beautiful But its citizens are kindly and simple for all that and many stopped to drop emeralds in the pilgrims cup and ask him if there was anything else that he needed To all he mumbled in a strange and indistinguishable tongue and seeing that he was bound for the palace and sure that Ozma herself would know best how to deal with him the Emerald Cityites let him go his way unmolested The afternoon was warm and pleasant and Ozma and some of her favorites were having a lazy game of croquet in the royal garden The click of the gold mallets as they tapped the gold balls presently attracted the attention of the old wayfarer who paused to peer curiously over the hedge The simple summer dresses of the girls in the garden seemed out of all keeping with their majestic surroundings Except for Ozmas frock which was longer the emerald crown on her dark curls and the golden circlets worn by her three companions they might have been any four little girls playing croquet in a garden But all around were the unmistakable signs of rank and royalty At ease under a lime tree stood a tall soldier with green whiskers leaning on his gun Three footmen in satin uniforms stood stiffly beside an emeraldtopped tea table ready at a moments notice to serve Ozade and frosted cake On a gold bench nearby a strawstuffed scarecrow was quietly reading the paper and walking arm in arm down a little path talking composedly together were an energetic little man with a bald head and a curious fellow who seemed to be constructed entirely of copper To all who are familiar with the quaint and merry folk at Ozmas court there would be nothing odd about a live scarecrow or a mechanical man and most of us would have recognized Ozmas companions at once as Dorothy Betsy and Trot three mortal girls who long ago came to live in the royal palace It was Dorothy who had discovered the Scarecrow on her first visit to Oz lifting him down from his pole and traveling in his gay and carefree company all the way to the Emerald City In those days the Wizard of Oz had been ruler of the country he himself having flown in a balloon from Omaha Astonished by the circus tricks of this little fellow the Ozians believing him to be a real wizard made him their sovereign and under his wise rule and direction built the now famous City of Emeralds The sight of Dorothy had made the humbug wizard homesick and after presenting the Scarecrow with a fine set of brains he flew off to America in a balloon of his own construction leaving the straw man to rule in his place Afterward when Ozma was disenchanted and proved to be the rightful ruler of Oz the Scarecrow had cheerfully resigned But he still spends most of his time in the palace and is one of Ozmas most trusted friends and counselors Later the Wizard himself returned to Oz and this time took up the study of magic with such zeal and earnestness he was soon famous from one end of the country to the other This made him exceedingly valuable to the young fairy ruler and he like the Scarecrow is an old and honored member of Ozmas cabinet It was the Wizard who was now talking so earnestly to Tik Tok The Metal Man was another of Dorothys discoveries She met Tik Tok on her second visit to Oz and brought him to the Emerald City for safekeeping Tik Tok made by the firm of Smith and Tinker is a completely mechanical man and a loyal and dependable citizen when he is properly wound up and oiled Betsy and Trot like Dorothy arrived more or less by wind wave and accident in the Land of Oz They liked it so well and proved so gay and amusing that Ozma begged them to stay with her and Dorothy in the green castle and help rule the many merry Kingdoms that make up her wonderful empire This they were only too happy to do so here they are Princesses in their own right and living in the most gorgeous City out of the world Besides the celebrities in the garden there are numerous other important people at Ozmas court For instance there is Herby the Medicine Man whose chest is really a medicine chest full of pills cures and ointments Then there is Scraps a lively girl made from a patchwork quilt by a wizards wife and brought to life by the wizard and theres Pigasus a flying pig Theres a doubtful dromedary a cowardly lion a hungry tiger and Dorothys little dog Toto a glass cat belonging to Scrap
