w sat beside the fire examining a heap of the glittering crystals from Alberifs island Just sketch Peakenspire Island on the chart there where Ive made the cross he directed looking up with an absent smile as the little boy came over to warm himself at the cheerful blaze Youre such a hand with a brush even in so small a place you can give a good idea of the City of Bridges And a good idea they are murmured Ato who was busy mending his fishing nets on the other side of the fireplace In every port we learn something new eh Mate All mountains no matter how high and peaked could be lived on if they were properly bridged True quite true agreed Samuel squinting contentedly through his magnifying glass while Tandy began sketching in the latest discovery on the sea chart Ive written it all up in my journal and put down Peakenspire Island as able to accommodate a thousand settlers from Oz and as an especially good place for poets Provided they are deaf put in Ato looking comically over his specs AYE DEE AYE DEE OH While you fellows were aloft I got to yodeling so fast and furious I blew all the saucepans off their hooks Yes that is one disadvantage admitted Samuel glancing approvingly at Tandys picture of Alberifs Island but never mind we dont have to live there and think of the splendid specimens weve brought away Mates Samuel ran his fingers lovingly through the heap of crystals and strands of metal Alberif had given him And those fruit and vegetable vines will provision us for the whole voyage Theyre a great comfort to me I assure you muttered Ato holding up his net to the light to see whether there were any more holes Now I know Kobo will never starve I put a vegetable vine in a box on her raft and that leaves two for us two for Ozma and maybe Tandy would like to take the other two home with him Home Tandy swung round in positive dismay Oh were not near Ozamaland yet are we Captain His voice sounded so dismal Samuel Salt threw down his magnifying glass with a roar of merriment Shiver my timbers lad one would think you did not wish to reach Ozamaland at all he blustered teasingly Whats the matter with that country of yours You wouldnt keep an honest explorer from adding a creeping bird and a flying reptile to his collection now would ye No No Of course not answered Tandy quickly But perhaps it is farther away than you think Master Salt and perhaps the Greys have conquered the Whites and then I wont be King any more Whats this Whats this Ato lifted his nose like an old hound that has just finished a fox for he loved a good story even better than he loved a good meal Who are the Greys and Whites my lad You never told us anything about this Theres really not much to tell sighed Tandy seating himself on a small stool before the fire In the first place I suppose you know that the great continent of Tarara is divided into two large long countries Ozamaland is on the east coast and Amaland on the west coast Now Ill just make a note of that said Samuel Salt leaning over to pull his journal toward him My country went on Tandy slowly is made up largely of desert and jungle best known for its white elephants and camels and the famous White City of Om first King and ruler of the Kingdom The Zamas are fierce and still wild tribesmen living in tents on the desert and in huts in the jungle Only the thousand Nobles and their families who live in the White City have been taught to read and write and live under roofs That is why the Kings of Ozamaland are so well guarded and never allowed out of the capital Then Id rather be a tribesman sniffed Ato letting his nets drop in a heap around his feet But theres no choice said Tandy thoughtfully The nine Ozamandarins who make the laws have decreed that the King shall remain in the White City Well what about those Whites and Greys asked Samuel Salt pulling out his pipe and leaning down close to the fire so Sally could light it for him My people because they dress in white robes and turbans are known as the Whites and the Amas the rough plainsmen who rove the long ranges of Amaland are the Greys The Amas care for nothing but their swift grey horses and often charge over the border to make war on my countrymen Then the Whites mounted on their white elephants and camels have all they can do to hold their own Aha thats what Id call a REAL battle exclaimed Ato his eyes snapping with enthusiasm and interest Then noting Samuels disapproving frown he pursed up his lips shook his head and added quickly All very wild and disorderly Tandy my lad Seems as if the Whites and Greys should manage their affairs more peaceably Yes said Tandy solemnly and Ive often thought when I was grown Id ride over on my white elephant to visit the Greys and see why they are so unfriendly A good idea and if I were you I wouldnt wait till I was grown Id do it as soon as I got back advised Samuel Salt taking a long pull at his pipe And very probably get himself cut up and captured shuddered Ato shaking his head Well hes
