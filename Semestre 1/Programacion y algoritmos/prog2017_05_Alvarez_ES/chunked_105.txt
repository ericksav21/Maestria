 kindness I am only a machine said Tiktok I can not be kind any more than I can be sorry or glad I can only do what I am wound up to do Are you wound up to keep my secret asked the Wheeler anxiously Yes if you behave yourself But tell me who rules the Land of Ev now asked the machine There is no ruler was the answer because every member of the royal family is imprisoned by the Nome King But the Princess Langwidere who is a niece of our late King Evoldo lives in a part of the royal palace and takes as much money out of the royal treasury as she can spend The Princess Langwidere is not exactly a ruler you see because she doesnt rule but she is the nearest approach to a ruler we have at present I do not remember her said Tiktok What does she look like That I cannot say replied the Wheeler although I have seen her twenty times For the Princess Langwidere is a different person every time I see her and the only way her subjects can recognize her at all is by means of a beautiful ruby key which she always wears on a chain attached to her left wrist When we see the key we know we are beholding the Princess That is strange said Dorothy in astonishment Do you mean to say that so many different princesses are one and the same person Not exactly answered the Wheeler There is of course but one princess but she appears to us in many forms which are all more or less beautiful She must be a witch exclaimed the girl I do not think so declared the Wheeler But there is some mystery connected with her nevertheless She is a very vain creature and lives mostly in a room surrounded by mirrors so that she can admire herself whichever way she looks No one answered this speech because they had just passed out of the forest and their attention was fixed upon the scene before thema beautiful vale in which were many fruit trees and green fields with pretty farmhouses scattered here and there and broad smooth roads that led in every direction In the center of this lovely vale about a mile from where our friends were standing rose the tall spires of the royal palace which glittered brightly against their background of blue sky The palace was surrounded by charming grounds full of flowers and shrubbery Several tinkling fountains could be seen and there were pleasant walks bordered by rows of white marble statuary All these details Dorothy was of course unable to notice or admire until they had advanced along the road to a position quite near to the palace and she was still looking at the pretty sights when her little party entered the grounds and approached the big front door of the kings own apartments To their disappointment they found the door tightly closed A sign was tacked to the panel which read as follows OWNER ABSENT Please Knock at the Third Door in the Left Wing Now said Tiktok to the captive Wheeler you must show us the way to the Left Wing Very well agreed the prisoner it is around here at the right How can the left wing be at the right demanded Dorothy who feared the Wheeler was fooling them Because there used to be three wings and two were torn down so the one on the right is the only one left It is a trick of the Princess Langwidere to prevent visitors from annoying her Then the captive led them around to the wing after which the machine man having no further use for the Wheeler permitted him to depart and rejoin his fellows He immediately rolled away at a great pace and was soon lost to sight Tiktok now counted the doors in the wing and knocked loudly upon the third one It was opened by a little maid in a cap trimmed with gay ribbons who bowed respectfully and asked What do you wish good people Are you the Princess Langwidere asked Dorothy No miss I am her servant replied the maid May I see the Princess please I will tell her you are here miss and ask her to grant you an audience said the maid Step in please and take a seat in the drawingroom So Dorothy walked in followed closely by the machine But as the yellow hen tried to enter after them the little maid cried Shoo and flapped her apron in Billinas face Shoo yourself retorted the hen drawing back in anger and ruffling up her feathers Havent you any better manners than that Oh do you talk enquired the maid evidently surprised Cant you hear me snapped Billina Drop that apron and get out of the doorway so that I may enter with my friends The Princess wont like it said the maid hesitating I dont care whether she likes it or not replied Billina and fluttering her wings with a loud noise she flew straight at the maids face The little servant at once ducked her head and the hen reached Dorothys side in safety Very well sighed the maid if you are all ruined because of this obstinate hen dont blame me for it It isnt safe to annoy the Princess Langwidere Tell her we are waiting if you please Dorothy requested with dignity Billina is my friend and must go wherever I go Without more words the maid led them to a richly furnished drawingroom lighted with subdued rainbow tints that c
