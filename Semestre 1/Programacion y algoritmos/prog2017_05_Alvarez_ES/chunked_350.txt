lder to be sure the white Ox was not going to tread on his heels Youll be there in no time no time at all he assured them earnestly Step over here please Moving a sliding door in the wall of the corridor the Kings assistant waved them toward a smooth wheelless silver carriage It looked to Handy a lot like an oldfashioned sleigh and as there were seats in front and a space in back large enough for the Ox she let go Nifflepoks hand and quite willingly climbed aboard Nox grunting a little stepped over the side and settled himself behind her Well goodbye sniffed Nifflepok rubbing his bruised fingers tenderly Youll find everything you need below not that youll be needing anything he added mournfully as he pulled out a silver switch Goodbye Im sorry for you he shouted as the car with a lurch that almost loosened Handys teeth shot down a sliding runway to the deep pits of darkness below Now you and I who are used to scenic railways and have enjoyed the thrills of chute the chutes for years would have been less startled by the wild dizzy leaps the swoops curves and climbs and the sickening drops of the Silver Kings chariot But neither the Goat Girl nor the Royal Ox had ever heard of a scenic railway much less ridden in one and the underground car of the Silver Monarch was more like a chute the chutes than anything else Sometimes the two travelers were in complete darkness at other times they whirled by the narrow welllighted ledges of a queer cave city where the subjects of the Mountain King lived in celllike apertures in the silver rock like the cliff dwellers of old Then without warning the car would plunge to the work caverns below past the gloomy shafts of the silver mines or dart up to the living quarters and grottoes of the King himself caves so lavishly furnished and glowing with jewels Handy let out little shrieks of astonishment In the Kings subterranean gardens silver swallows bathed in the silver fountains silver maples rustled their lacy branches in the lavenderscented breezes silverpetalled flowers with jeweled centers grew as riotously as daisies and buttercups in the upstairs world The mountaineers themselves working listlessly with pick and shovel in the mines or walking soberly along the ledges beside their little cliff dwellings seemed undersized and unhappy to the Goat Girl Not that she caught more than a flying glimpse of them as the silver car tore by In fact she was so frantically busy holding on to the front rail of the car with all her various hands and catching her breath after each dizzy swoop that her mind was in a perfect whirl The groans and snorts of Nox were far from reassuring but afraid to look back lest she herself be flung out Handy clung desperately to the rail wondering when the wild ride would end and where under the mountain the silver car was taking them The last words of Nifflepok rang unpleasantly in her ears and as they raced by a cave marked Potters Den the Goat Girl positively shuddered Here set out in vast silver pots and buried to their chins in the silver earth were scores of the Kings palefaced prisoners A grimlooking gardener was watering them from a milk can and from the hungry way they lapped up the few drops that fell to them Handy concluded that this was probably their only food First I shot over a mountain and now Im shooting through one moaned the distracted Goat Girl trying to collect her spinning thoughts and faculties Oh myC4y were going to pot for sure Oh this time we are really done for Then all at once Handys good common sense began to assert itself And as their strange chariot with a sudden increase of speed and power again dashed down into the darkness she snatched the precious blue flower from her pocket and at the exact moment the silver car turned over and flung them into space Handy began pulling the petals from the flower and letting them drift down ahead of her own rapidly falling body It was just light enough for her to see Nox with bristling horns and quivering nostrils fall past when she herself started to turn so many and such dizzy somersaults she lost all count of time and distance CHAPTER 12 PRISONERS OF THE WIZARD What seemed to be hours later though in reality it was only a few moments the two luckless prisoners found themselves side by side on a heap of soft blue flower petals They were in a small circular pit with one amethyst burning dimly in the grating that covered the top The Goat Girl had no recollection of her final landing and gazing up at the grilled ceiling wondered dully how they had come through without being cut to pieces It tilted wheezed the Royal Ox answering the unspoken question in Handys eyes just tilted and slid us down20A fortunate thing you kept that magic flower mlass HaC4rumph Weakly and still trembling in every limb Nox tried to rise but his legs gave way beneath him and for a good fifteen minutes he and the Goat Girl rested on the flower petals saying never a word The tapping of footsteps in the corridor brough
