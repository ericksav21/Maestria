o prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her 9 The Queen of the Field Mice We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the Scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them It was indeed a great yellow Wildcat and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature So the Woodman raised his axe and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beasts head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces The field mouse now that it was freed from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said in a squeaky little voice Oh thank you Thank you ever so much for saving my life Dont speak of it I beg of you replied the Woodman I have no heart you know so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse Only a mouse cried the little animal indignantly Why I am a Queenthe Queen of all the Field Mice Oh indeed said the Woodman making a bow Therefore you have done a great deed as well as a brave one in saving my life added the Queen At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed Oh your Majesty we thought you would be killed How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat They all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads This funny tin man she answered killed the Wildcat and saved my life So hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish We will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus And then they scampered in all directions for Toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas and he saw no harm in it But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice Come back Come back Toto shall not hurt you At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice Are you sure he will not bite us I will not let him said the Woodman so do not be afraid One by one the mice came creeping back and Toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the Woodmans arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin Finally one of the biggest mice spoke Is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our Queen Nothing that I know of answered the Woodman but the Scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly Oh yes you can save our friend the Cowardly Lion who is asleep in the poppy bed A Lion cried the little Queen Why he would eat us all up Oh no declared the Scarecrow this Lion is a coward Really asked the Mouse He says so himself answered the Scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness Very well said the Queen we trust you But what shall we do Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you Oh yes there are thousands she replied Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible Now said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them They came from all directions and there were thousands of them big mice and little mice and middlesized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice st
