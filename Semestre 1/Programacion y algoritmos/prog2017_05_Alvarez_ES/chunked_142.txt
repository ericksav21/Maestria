solar rays The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed the presence of the strangers but then he stopped abruptly There was no expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face yet he must have been both astonished and afraid for after his eyes had rested upon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly to the furthest edge of the roof his head turned back over his shoulder to gaze at the strange animal Look out cried Dorothy who noticed that the beautiful man did not look where he was going be careful or youll fall off But he paid no attention to her warning He reached the edge of the tall roof stepped one foot out into the air and walked into space as calmly as if he were on firm ground The girl greatly astonished ran to lean over the edge of the roof and saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground Soon he reached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one of the glass buildings How strange she exclaimed drawing a long breath Yes but its lots of fun if it IS strange remarked the small voice of the kitten and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the air a foot or so away from the edge of the roof Come back Eureka she called in distress youll certainly be killed I have nine lives said the kitten purring softly as it walked around in a circle and then came back to the roof but I cant lose even one of them by falling in this country because I really couldnt manage to fall if I wanted to Does the air bear up your weight asked the girl Of course cant you see and again the kitten wandered into the air and back to the edge of the roof Its wonderful said Dorothy Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to help us suggested Zeb who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at these strange happenings Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves replied the girl Zeb drew back with a shiver I wouldnt dare try he said Maybe Jim will go continued Dorothy looking at the horse And maybe he wont answered Jim Ive tumbled through the air long enough to make me contented on this roof But we didnt tumble to the roof said the girl by the time we reached here we were floating very slowly and Im almost sure we could float down to the street without getting hurt Eureka walks on the air all right Eureka weights only about half a pound replied the horse in a scornful tone while I weigh about half a ton You dont weigh as much as you ought to Jim remarked the girl shaking her head as she looked at the animal Youre dreadfully skinny Oh well Im old said the horse hanging his head despondently and Ive had lots of trouble in my day little one For a good many years I drew a public cab in Chicago and thats enough to make anyone skinny He eats enough to get fat Im sure said the boy gravely Do I Can you remember any breakfast that Ive had today growled Jim as if he resented Zebs speech None of us has had breakfast said the boy and in a time of danger like this its foolish to talk about eating Nothing is more dangerous than being without food declared the horse with a sniff at the rebuke of his young master and just at present no one can tell whether there are any oats in this queer country or not If there are they are liable to be glass oats Oh no exclaimed Dorothy I can see plenty of nice gardens and fields down below us at the edge of this city But I wish we could find a way to get to the ground Why dont you walk down asked Eureka Im as hungry as the horse is and I want my milk Will you try it Zeb asked the girl turning to her companion Zeb hesitated He was still pale and frightened for this dreadful adventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried But he did not wish the little girl to think him a coward so he advanced slowly to the edge of the roof Dorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let it rest in the air a little over the edge of the roof It seemed firm enough to walk upon so he took courage and put out the other foot Dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him and soon they were both walking through the air with the kitten frisking beside them Come on Jim called the boy Its all right Jim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over and being a sensible horse and quite experienced he made up his mind that he could go where the others did So with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his short tail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floating downward to the street His great weight made him fall faster than the children walked and he passed them on the way down but when he came to the glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not even jarred Well well said Dorothy drawing a long breath What a strange country this is People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled There were men and women but no children at all and the folks were all beautifully formed and attractively dressed and had wonder
