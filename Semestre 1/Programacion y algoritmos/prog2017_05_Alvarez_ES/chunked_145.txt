down than I intended But never mind It isnt everybody who gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos Mangaboos said the Sorcerer correcting him If you are a Wizard you ought to be able to call people by their right names Oh Im a Wizard you may be sure of that Just as good a Wizard as you are a Sorcerer That remains to be seen said the other If you are able to prove that you are better said the Prince to the little man I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain Otherwise What will happen otherwise asked the Wizard I will stop you from living and forbid you to be planted returned the Prince That does not sound especially pleasant said the little man looking at the one with the star uneasily But never mind Ill beat Old Prickly all right My name is Gwig said the Sorcerer turning his heartless cruel eyes upon his rival Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about to perform He waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard playing sweet music Yet look where she would Dorothy could discover no bells at all in the great glass hall The Mangaboo people listened but showed no great interest It was one of the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer Now was the Wizards turn so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked Will somebody kindly loan me a hat No one did because the Mangaboos did not wear hats and Zeb had lost his somehow in his flight through the air Ahem said the Wizard will somebody please loan me a handkerchief But they had no handkerchiefs either Very good remarked the Wizard Ill use my own hat if you please Now good people observe me carefully You see there is nothing up my sleeve and nothing concealed about my person Also my hat is quite empty He took off his hat and held it upside down shaking it briskly Let me see it said the Sorcerer He took the hat and examined it carefully returning it afterward to the Wizard Now said the little man I will create something out of nothing He placed the hat upon the glass floor made a pass with his hand and then removed the hat displaying a little white piglet no bigger than a mouse which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squeal in a tiny shrill voice The people watched it intently for they had never seen a pig before big or little The Wizard reached out caught the wee creature in his hand and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tail between the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart each of the two parts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant He placed one upon the floor so that it could run around and pulled apart the other making three piglets in all and then one of these was pulled apart making four piglets The Wizard continued this surprising performance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet all squealing and grunting in a very comical way Now said the Wizard of Oz having created something from nothing I will make something nothing again With this he caught up two of the piglets and pushed them together so that the two were one Then he caught up another piglet and pushed it into the first where it disappeared And so one by one the nine tiny piglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creatures remained This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mystic sign above it When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappeared entirely The little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him and then the Prince said in his cold calm voice You are indeed a wonderful Wizard and your powers are greater than those of my Sorcerer He will not be a wonderful Wizard long remarked Gwig Why not enquired the Wizard Because I am going to stop your breath was the reply I perceive that you are curiously constructed and that if you cannot breathe you cannot keep alive The little man looked troubled How long will it take you to stop my breath he asked About five minutes Im going to begin now Watch me carefully He began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard but the little man did not watch him long Instead he drew a leathern case from his pocket and took from it several sharp knives which he joined together one after another until they made a long sword By the time he had attached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe as the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect So the Wizard lost no more time but leaping forward he raised the sharp sword whirled it once or twice around his head and then gave a mighty stroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two Dorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight but as the two halves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had no bones or blood inside of him at all and that the place where he was cut looked much like a sliced turnip or potato Why hes vegetable cried the Wizard astonished Of course said the Prince We are all vegetable in this country Are you not vegetable also No answered the Wizard People on top of the earth are all meat Will
