 your Sorcerer die Certainly sir He is really dead now and will wither very quickly So we must plant him at once that other Sorcerers may grow upon his bush continued the Prince What do you mean by that asked the little Wizard greatly puzzled If you will accompany me to our public gardens replied the Prince I will explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of our Vegetable Kingdom 4 The Vegetable Kingdom After the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken it apart and put the pieces into their leathern case again the man with the star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of the Sorcerer to the public gardens Jim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens and wanted to join the party thinking he might find something proper to eat so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to ride with them The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the two children and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped upon his back and sat there quite contentedly So the procession moved through the streets the bearers of the Sorcerer first the Prince next then Jim drawing the buggy with the strangers inside of it and last the crowd of vegetable people who had no hearts and could neither smile nor frown The glass city had several fine streets for a good many people lived there but when the procession had passed through these it came upon a broad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks that flowed through it There were paths through these gardens and over some of the brooks were ornamental glass bridges Dorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince so that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better Who built these lovely bridges asked the little girl No one built them answered the man with the star They grow Thats queer said she Did the glass houses in your city grow too Of course he replied But it took a good many years for them to grow as large and fine as they are now That is why we are so angry when a Rain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs Cant you mend them she enquired No but they will grow together again in time and we must wait until they do They first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers which grew nearest the city but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowers they were because the colors were constantly changing under the shifting lights of the six suns A flower would be pink one second white the next then blue or yellow and it was the same way when they came to the plants which had broad leaves and grew close to the ground When they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched down his head and began to nibble A nice country this is he grumbled where a respectable horse has to eat pink grass Its violet said the Wizard who was in the buggy Now its blue complained the horse As a matter of fact Im eating rainbow grass How does it taste asked the Wizard Not bad at all said Jim If they give me plenty of it Ill not complain about its color By this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field and the Prince said to Dorothy This is our plantingground Several Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in the ground Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and covered him up After that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkled the earth He will sprout very soon said the Prince and grow into a large bush from which we shall in time be able to pick several very good sorcerers Do all your people grow on bushes asked the boy Certainly was the reply Do not all people grow upon bushes where you came from on the outside of the earth Not that I ever hear of How strange But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens I will show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos It appeared that these odd people while they were able to walk through the air with ease usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way There were no stairs in their houses because they did not need them but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do The little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few more of the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a garden enclosed by a high hedge Jim had refused to leave the field of grass where he was engaged in busily eating so the Wizard got out of the buggy and joined Zeb and Dorothy and the kitten followed demurely at their heels Inside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsome plants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearly reached the ground In the center of each plant grew a daintily dressed Mangaboo for the clothing of all these creatures grew upon them and was attached to their bodies The growing Mangaboos were of all sizes from the blossom that had just turned into a wee baby to the fullgrown and almost ripe man or woman On some of the bushes might be seen a bud a blossom a baby
