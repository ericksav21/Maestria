 ill temper They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water and Jim ate it with much relish Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse slept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life In the morning as soon as it was daylight he resolved to take a walk and try to find some grass for breakfast so he ambled calmly through the handsome arch of the doorway turned the corner of the palace wherein all seemed asleep and came face to face with the Sawhorse Jim stopped abruptly being startled and amazed The Sawhorse stopped at the same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes which were mere knots in the log that formed its body The legs of the Sawhorse were four sticks driving into holes bored in the log its tail was a small branch that had been left by accident and its mouth a place chopped in one end of the body which projected a little and served as a head The ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold and the saddle of the Princess Ozma which was of red leather set with sparkling diamonds was strapped to the clumsy body Jims eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse and he stared at the creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it rested against his arched neck In this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each other for a while each being unable to realize what the singular thing might be which it now beheld for the first time Then Jim exclaimed For goodness sake what sort of a being are you Im a Sawhorse replied the other Oh I believe Ive heard of you said the cabhorse but you are unlike anything that I expected to see I do not doubt it the Sawhorse observed with a tone of pride I am considered quite unusual You are indeed But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to be alive I couldnt help it returned the other rather crestfallen Ozma sprinkled me with a magic powder and I just had to live I know Im not much account but Im the only horse in all the Land of Oz so they treat me with great respect You a horse Oh not a real one of course There are no real horses here at all But Im a splendid imitation of one Jim gave an indignant neigh Look at me he cried Behold a real horse The wooden animal gave a start and then examined the other intently Is it possible that you are a Real Horse he murmured Not only possible but true replied Jim who was gratified by the impression he had created It is proved by my fine points For example look at the long hairs on my tail with which I can whisk away the flies The flies never trouble me said the SawHorse And notice my great strong teeth with which I nibble the grass It is not necessary for me to eat observed the Sawhorse Also examine my broad chest which enables me to draw deep full breaths said Jim proudly I have no need to breathe returned the other No you miss many pleasures remarked the cabhorse pityingly You do not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you nor the delight of eating delicious food nor the satisfaction of drawing a long breath of fresh pure air You may be an imitation of a horse but youre a mighty poor one Oh I cannot hope ever to be like you sighed the Sawhorse But I am glad to meet a last a Real Horse You are certainly the most beautiful creature I ever beheld This praise won Jim completely To be called beautiful was a novelty in his experience Said he Your chief fault my friend is in being made of wood and that I suppose you cannot help Real horses like myself are made of flesh and blood and bones I can see the bones all right replied the Sawhorse and they are admirable and distinct Also I can see the flesh But the blood I suppose is tucked away inside Exactly said Jim What good is it asked the Sawhorse Jim did not know but he would not tell the Sawhorse that If anything cuts me he replied the blood runs out to show where I am cut You poor thing cannot even bleed when you are hurt But I am never hurt said the Sawhorse Once in a while I get broken up some but I am easily repaired and put in good order again And I never feel a break or a splinter in the least Jim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feel pain but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided he would not change places with it under any circumstances How did you happen to be shod with gold he asked Princess Ozma did that was the reply and it saves my legs from wearing out Weve had a good many adventures together Ozma and I and she likes me The cabhorse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a neigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf For around the corner had come two enormous savage beasts treading so lightly that they were upon him before he was aware of their presence Jim was in the act of plunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out Stop my brother Stop Real Horse These are friends and will do you no harm Jim hesitated eyeing the beasts fearfully One was an enormous Lion with
