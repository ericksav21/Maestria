ead with a silver moon shining sweetly in the middle of it and little stars winking merrily at Dorothy when she looked their way The coop did not toss around any more but rode the waves more gentlyalmost like a cradle rockingso that the floor upon which Dorothy stood was no longer swept by water coming through the slats Seeing this and being quite exhausted by the excitement of the past few hours the little girl decided that sleep would be the best thing to restore her strength and the easiest way in which she could pass the time The floor was damp and she was herself wringing wet but fortunately this was a warm climate and she did not feel at all cold So she sat down in a corner of the coop leaned her back against the slats nodded at the friendly stars before she closed her eyes and was asleep in half a minute 2 The Yellow Hen A strange noise awoke Dorothy who opened her eyes to find that day had dawned and the sun was shining brightly in a clear sky She had been dreaming that she was back in Kansas again and playing in the old barnyard with the calves and pigs and chickens all around her and at first as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes she really imagined she was there Kutkutkut kadawkut Kutkutkut kadawkut Ah here again was the strange noise that had awakened her Surely it was a hen cackling But her wideopen eyes first saw through the slats of the coop the blue waves of the ocean now calm and placid and her thoughts flew back to the past night so full of danger and discomfort Also she began to remember that she was a waif of the storm adrift upon a treacherous and unknown sea Kutkutkut kadawwwkut Whats that cried Dorothy starting to her feet Why Ive just laid an egg thats all replied a small but sharp and distinct voice and looking around her the little girl discovered a yellow hen squatting in the opposite corner of the coop Dear me she exclaimed in surprise have YOU been here all night too Of course answered the hen fluttering her wings and yawning When the coop blew away from the ship I clung fast to this corner with claws and beak for I knew if I fell into the water Id surely be drowned Indeed I nearly drowned as it was with all that water washing over me I never was so wet before in my life Yes agreed Dorothy it was pretty wet for a time I know But do you feel comforble now Not very The sun has helped to dry my feathers as it has your dress and I feel better since I laid my morning egg But whats to become of us I should like to know afloat on this big pond Id like to know that too said Dorothy But tell me how does it happen that you are able to talk I thought hens could only cluck and cackle Why as for that answered the yellow hen thoughtfully Ive clucked and cackled all my life and never spoken a word before this morning that I can remember But when you asked a question a minute ago it seemed the most natural thing in the world to answer you So I spoke and I seem to keep on speaking just as you and other human beings do Strange isnt it Very replied Dorothy If we were in the Land of Oz I wouldnt think it so queer because many of the animals can talk in that fairy country But out here in the ocean must be a good long way from Oz How is my grammar asked the yellow hen anxiously Do I speak quite properly in your judgment Yes said Dorothy you do very well for a beginner Im glad to know that continued the yellow hen in a confidential tone because if one is going to talk its best to talk correctly The red rooster has often said that my cluck and my cackle were quite perfect and now its a comfort to know I am talking properly Im beginning to get hungry remarked Dorothy Its breakfast time but theres no breakfast You may have my egg said the yellow hen I dont care for it you know Dont you want to hatch it asked the little girl in surprise No indeed I never care to hatch eggs unless Ive a nice snug nest in some quiet place with a bakers dozen of eggs under me Thats thirteen you know and its a lucky number for hens So you may as well eat this egg Oh I couldnt POSSBLY eat it unless it was cooked exclaimed Dorothy But Im much obliged for your kindness just the same Dont mention it my dear answered the hen calmly and began preening her feathers For a moment Dorothy stood looking out over the wide sea She was still thinking of the egg though so presently she asked Why do you lay eggs when you dont expect to hatch them Its a habit I have replied the yellow hen It has always been my pride to lay a fresh egg every morning except when Im moulting I never feel like having my morning cackle till the egg is properly laid and without the chance to cackle I would not be happy Its strange said the girl reflectively but as Im not a hen I cant be spected to understand that Certainly not my dear Then Dorothy fell silent again The yellow hen was some company and a bit of comfort too but it was dreadfully lonely out on the big ocean nevertheless After a time the hen flew up and perched upon the topmost slat of the coop which wa
