of black bees came flying toward her Go to the strangers and sting them to death commanded the Witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were walking But the Woodman had seen them coming and the Scarecrow had decided what to do Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the Lion he said to the Woodman and the bees cannot sting them This the Woodman did and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the Woodman at all And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman like little heaps of fine coal Then Dorothy and the Lion got up and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again until he was as good as ever So they started upon their journey once more The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth And then she called a dozen of her slaves who were the Winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them The Winkies were not a brave people but they had to do as they were told So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful Witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act There was in her cupboard a Golden Cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it This Golden Cap had a charm Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys who would obey any order they were given But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their country The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself and driven him out of the land of the West The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this Only once more could she use this Golden Cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly Eppe peppe kakke Next she stood upon her right foot and said Hillo hollo hello After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice Zizzy zuzzy zik Now the charm began to work The sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air There was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders One much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader He flew close to the Witch and said You have called us for the third and last time What do you command Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion said the Wicked Witch Bring that beast to me for I have a mind to harness him like a horse and make him work Your commands shall be obeyed said the leader Then with a great deal of chattering and noise the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her friends were walking Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks Here they dropped the poor Woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witchs castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape But Dorothy they did not harm at all She stood
