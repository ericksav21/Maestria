Lion and the Hungry Tiger were still there but they having also eaten some of the cakes had gone to sleep at one side of the cave while upon the other side stood the Sawhorse motionless and silent as became a mere thing of wood Billina had quietly walked around and picked up the crumbs of cake which had been scattered and now as it was long after bedtime she tried to find some dark place in which to go to sleep Presently the hen espied a hollow underneath the Kings rocky throne and crept into it unnoticed She could still hear the chattering of those around her but it was almost dark underneath the throne so that soon she had fallen fast asleep Next called the King and the private whose turn it was to enter the fatal palace shook hands with Dorothy and the Scarecrow and bade them a sorrowful goodbye and passed through the rocky portal They waited a long time for the private was in no hurry to become an ornament and made his guesses very slowly The Nome King who seemed to know by some magical power all that took place in his beautiful rooms of his palace grew impatient finally and declared he would sit up no longer I love ornaments said he but I can wait until tomorrow to get more of them so as soon as that stupid private is transformed we will all go to bed and leave the job to be finished in the morning Is it so very late asked Dorothy Why it is after midnight said the King and that strikes me as being late enough There is neither night nor day in my kingdom because it is under the earths surface where the sun does not shine But we have to sleep just the same as the upstairs people do and for my part Im going to bed in a few minutes Indeed it was not long after this that the private made his last guess Of course he guessed wrongly and of course he at once became an ornament So the King was greatly pleased and clapped his hands to summon his Chief Steward Show these guests to some of the sleeping apartments he commanded and be quick about it too for Im dreadfully sleepy myself Youve no business to sit up so late replied the Steward gruffly Youll be as cross as a griffin tomorrow morning His Majesty made no answer to this remark and the Chief Steward led Dorothy through another doorway into a long hall from which several plain but comfortable sleeping rooms opened The little girl was given the first room and the Scarecrow and Tiktok the nextalthough they never sleptand the Lion and the Tiger the third The Sawhorse hobbled after the Steward into a fourth room to stand stiffly in the center of it until morning Each night was rather a bore to the Scarecrow Tiktok and the Sawhorse but they had learned from experience to pass the time patiently and quietly since all their friends who were made of flesh had to sleep and did not like to be disturbed When the Chief Steward had left them alone the Scarecrow remarked sadly I am in great sorrow over the loss of my old comrade the Tin Woodman We have had many dangerous adventures together and escaped them all and now it grieves me to know he has become an ornament and is lost to me forever He was always an ornament to society said Tiktok True but now the Nome King laughs at him and calls him the funniest ornament in all the palace It will hurt my poor friends pride to be laughed at continued the Scarecrow sadly We will make rather absurd ornaments ourselves tomorrow observed the machine in his monotonous voice Just then Dorothy ran into their room in a state of great anxiety crying Wheres Billina Have you seen Billina Is she here No answered the Scarecrow Then what has become of her asked the girl Why I thought she was with you said the Scarecrow Yet I do not remember seeing the yellow hen since she picked up the crumbs of cake We must have left her in the room where the Kings throne is decided Dorothy and at once she turned and ran down the hall to the door through which they had entered But it was fast closed and locked on the other side and the heavy slab of rock proved to be so thick that no sound could pass through it So Dorothy was forced to return to her chamber The Cowardly Lion stuck his head into her room to try to console the girl for the loss of her feathered friend The yellow hen is well able to take care of herself said he so dont worry about her but try to get all the sleep you can It has been a long and weary day and you need rest Ill probly get lots of rest tomorrow when I become an ornment said Dorothy sleepily But she lay down upon her couch nevertheless and in spite of all her worries was soon in the land of dreams 14 Dorothy Tries to be Brave Meantime the Chief Steward had returned to the throne room where he said to the King You are a fool to waste so much time upon these people What cried his Majesty in so enraged a voice that it awoke Billina who was asleep under his throne How dare you call me a fool Because I like to speak the truth said the Steward Why didnt you enchant them all at once instead of allowing them to go one by one into the palace
