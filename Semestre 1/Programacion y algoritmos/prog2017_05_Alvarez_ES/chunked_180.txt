 more arose and addressed her Your Highness said he see how easy it is for a jury to be mistaken The kitten could not have eaten your pigletfor here it is He took off his funnel hat and from beneath it produced a tiny white piglet which he held aloft that all might see it clearly Ozma was delighted and exclaimed eagerly Give me my pet Nick Chopper And all the people cheered and clapped their hands rejoicing that the prisoner had escaped death and been proved to be innocent As the Princess held the white piglet in her arms and stroked its soft hair she said Let Eureka out of the cage for she is no longer a prisoner but our good friend Where did you find my missing pet Nick Chopper In a room of the palace he answered Justice remarked the Scarecrow with a sigh is a dangerous thing to meddle with If you hadnt happened to find the piglet Eureka would surely have been executed But justice prevailed at the last said Ozma for here is my pet and Eureka is once more free I refuse to be free cried the kitten in a sharp voice unless the Wizard can do his trick with eight piglets If he can produce but seven then this is not the piglet that was lost but another one Hush Eureka warned the Wizard Dont be foolish advised the Tin Woodman or you may be sorry for it The piglet that belonged to the Princess wore an emerald collar said Eureka loudly enough for all to hear So it did exclaimed Ozma This cannot be the one the Wizard gave me Of course not he had nine of them altogether declared Eureka and I must say it was very stingy of him not to let me eat just a few But now that this foolish trial is ended I will tell you what really became of your pet piglet At this everyone in the Throne Room suddenly became quiet and the kitten continued in a calm mocking tone of voice I will confess that I intended to eat the little pig for my breakfast so I crept into the room where it was kept while the Princess was dressing and hid myself under a chair When Ozma went away she closed the door and left her pet on the table At once I jumped up and told the piglet not to make a fuss for he would be inside of me in half a second but no one can teach one of these creatures to be reasonable Instead of keeping still so I could eat him comfortably he trembled so with fear that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standing on the floor The vase had a very small neck and spread out at the top like a bowl At first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and I thought I should get him after all but he wriggled himself through and fell down into the deep bottom partand I suppose hes there yet All were astonished at this confession and Ozma at once sent an officer to her room to fetch the vase When he returned the Princess looked down the narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet just as Eureka had said she would There was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase so the Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner free Then the crowd cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten in her arms and told her how delighted she was to know that she was innocent But why didnt you tell us at first she asked It would have spoiled the fun replied the kitten yawning Ozma gave the Wizard back the piglet he had so kindly allowed Nick Chopper to substitute for the lost one and then she carried her own into the apartments of the palace where she lived And now the trial being over the good citizens of the Emerald City scattered to their homes well content with the days amusement 20 Zeb Returns to the Ranch Eureka was much surprised to find herself in disgrace but she was in spite of the fact that she had not eaten the piglet For the folks of Oz knew the kitten had tried to commit the crime and that only an accident had prevented her from doing so therefore even the Hungry Tiger preferred not to associate with her Eureka was forbidden to wander around the palace and was made to stay in confinement in Dorothys room so she began to beg her mistress to send her to some other place where she could enjoy herself better Dorothy was herself anxious to get home so she promised Eureka they would not stay in the Land of Oz much longer The next evening after the trial the little girl begged Ozma to allow her to look in the enchanted picture and the Princess readily consented She took the child to her room and said Make your wish dear and the picture will show the scene you desire to behold Then Dorothy found with the aid of the enchanted picture that Uncle Henry had returned to the farm in Kansas and she also saw that both he and Aunt Em were dressed in mourning because they thought their little niece had been killed by the earthquake Really said the girl anxiously I must get back as soon as possble to my own folks Zeb also wanted to see his home and although he did not find anyone morning for him the sight of Hugsons Ranch in the picture made him long to get back there This is a fine country and I like all the peop
