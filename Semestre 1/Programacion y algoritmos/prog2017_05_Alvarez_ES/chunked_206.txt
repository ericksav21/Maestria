 thought Johnny Dooit looked as if he had done a lot of hard work in his lifetime Good morning Johnny said the shaggy man Thank you for coming to me so quickly I never waste time said the newcomer promptly But whats happened to you Where did you get that donkey head Really I wouldnt have known you at all Shaggy Man if I hadnt looked at your feet The shaggy man introduced Johnny Dooit to Dorothy and Toto and ButtonBright and the Rainbows Daughter and told him the story of their adventures adding that they were anxious now to reach the Emerald City in the Land of Oz where Dorothy had friends who would take care of them and send them safe home again But said he we find that we cant cross this desert which turns all living flesh that touches it into dust so I have asked you to come and help us Johnny Dooit puffed his pipe and looked carefully at the dreadful desert in front of themstretching so far away they could not see its end You must ride he said briskly What in asked the shaggy man In a sandboat which has runners like a sled and sails like a ship The wind will blow you swiftly across the desert and the sand cannot touch your flesh to turn it into dust Good cried Dorothy clapping her hands delightedly That was the way the Magic Carpet took us across We didnt have to touch the horrid sand at all But where is the sandboat asked the shaggy man looking all around him Ill make you one said Johnny Dooit As he spoke he knocked the ashes from his pipe and put it in his pocket Then he unlocked the copper chest and lifted the lid and Dorothy saw it was full of shining tools of all sorts and shapes Johnny Dooit moved quickly nowso quickly that they were astonished at the work he was able to accomplish He had in his chest a tool for everything he wanted to do and these must have been magic tools because they did their work so fast and so well The man hummed a little song as he worked and Dorothy tried to listen to it She thought the words were something like these The only way to do a thing Is do it when you can And do it cheerfully and sing And work and think and plan The only real unhappy one Is he who dares to shirk The only really happy one Is he who cares to work Whatever Johnny Dooit was singing he was certainly doing things and they all stood by and watched him in amazement He seized an axe and in a couple of chops felled a tree Next he took a saw and in a few minutes sawed the treetrunk into broad long boards He then nailed the boards together into the shape of a boat about twelve feet long and four feet wide He cut from another tree a long slender pole which when trimmed of its branches and fastened upright in the center of the boat served as a mast From the chest he drew a coil of rope and a big bundle of canvas and with thesestill humming his songhe rigged up a sail arranging it so it could be raised or lowered upon the mast Dorothy fairly gasped with wonder to see the thing grow so speedily before her eyes and both ButtonBright and Polly looked on with the same absorbed interest It ought to be painted said Johnny Dooit tossing his tools back into the chest for that would make it look prettier But though I can paint it for you in three seconds it would take an hour to dry and thats a waste of time We dont care how it looks said the shaggy man if only it will take us across the desert It will do that declared Johnny Dooit All you need worry about is tipping over Did you ever sail a ship Ive seen one sailed said the shaggy man Good Sail this boat the way youve seen a ship sailed and youll be across the sands before you know it With this he slammed down the lid of the chest and the noise made them all wink While they were winking the workman disappeared tools and all 12 The Deadly Desert Crossed Oh thats too bad cried Dorothy I wanted to thank Johnny Dooit for all his kindness to us He hasnt time to listen to thanks replied the shaggy man but Im sure he knows we are grateful I suppose he is already at work in some other part of the world They now looked more carefully at the sandboat and saw that the bottom was modeled with two sharp runners which would glide through the sand The front of the sandboat was pointed like the bow of a ship and there was a rudder at the stern to steer by It had been built just at the edge of the desert so that all its length lay upon the gray sand except the after part which still rested on the strip of grass Get in my dears said the shaggy man Im sure I can manage this boat as well as any sailor All you need do is sit still in your places Dorothy got in Toto in her arms and sat on the bottom of the boat just in front of the mast ButtonBright sat in front of Dorothy while Polly leaned over the bow The shaggy man knelt behind the mast When all were ready he raised the sail halfway The wind caught it At once the sandboat started forwardslowly at first then with added speed The shaggy man pulled the sail way up and they flew so fast over the Deadly Desert that every one held fast to t
