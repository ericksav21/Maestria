of so unusual a creature for horses were unknown in this Land but those who lived in the Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights so after inspecting the cabhorse and noting the mild look in his big eyes the girl decided not to be afraid of him There are no stables here said the Wizard unless some have been built since I went away We have never needed them before answered Jellia for the Sawhorse lives in a room of the palace being much smaller and more natural in appearance than this great beast you have brought with you Do you mean that Im a freak asked Jim angrily Oh no she hastened to say there may be many more like you in the place you came from but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual This mollified Jim a little and after some thought the green maiden decided to give the cabhorse a room in the palace such a big building having many rooms that were seldom in use So Zeb unharnessed Jim and several of the servants then led the horse around to the rear where they selected a nice large apartment that he could have all to himself Then Jellia said to the Wizard Your own roomwhich was back of the great Throne Roomhas been vacant ever since you left us Would you like it again Yes indeed returned the little man It will seem like being at home again for I lived in that room for many many years He knew the way to it and a servant followed him carrying his satchel Zeb was also escorted to a roomso grand and beautiful that he almost feared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed lest he might dim their splendor In the closets he discovered many fancy costumes of rich velvets and brocades and one of the attendants told him to dress himself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be prepared to dine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hours time Opening from the chamber was a fine bathroom having a marble tub with perfumed water so the boy still dazed by the novelty of his surroundings indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvet costume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much worn clothing There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers with diamond buckles to accompany his new costume and when he was fully dressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before in his life He was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence of the Princess he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room more dainty and attractive than it was splendid Here he found Dorothy seated beside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stopped suddenly with a gasp of admiration But Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friends hand drawing him impulsively toward the lovely Princess who smiled most graciously upon her guest Then the Wizard entered and his presence relieved the boys embarrassment The little man was clothed in black velvet with many sparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast but his bald head and wrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive Ozma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built the Emerald City and united the Munchkins Gillikins Quadlings and Winkies into one people so when they were all four seated at the dinner table the Princess said Please tell me Mr Wizard whether you called yourself Oz after this great country or whether you believe my country is called Oz after you It is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about because you are of a strange race and my own name is Ozma No one I am sure is better able to explain this mystery than you That is true answered the little Wizard therefore it will give me pleasure to explain my connection with your country In the first place I must tell you that I was born in Omaha and my father who was a politician named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs Diggs being the last name because he could think of no more to go before it Taken altogether it was a dreadfully long name to weigh down a poor innocent child and one of the hardest lessons I ever learned was to remember my own name When I grew up I just called myself O Z because the other initials were PINHEAD and that spelled pinhead which was a reflection on my intelligence Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short said Ozma sympathetically But didnt you cut it almost too short Perhaps so replied the Wizard When a young man I ran away from home and joined a circus I used to call myself a Wizard and do tricks of ventriloquism What does that mean asked the Princess Throwing my voice into any object I pleased to make it appear that the object was speaking instead of me Also I began to make balloon ascensions On my balloon and on all the other articles I used in the circus I painted the two initials O Z to show that those things belonged to me One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the deserts to this beautiful country When the people saw me come from the sky they naturally thought me some superior creature and bowe
