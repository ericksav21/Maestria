y dear sir answered the stranger briskly Is not my name upon the card It is said the Scarecrow But may I ask what H M stands for H M means Highly Magnified returned the WoggleBug proudly Oh I see The Scarecrow viewed the stranger critically And are you in truth highly magnified Sir said the WoggleBug I take you for a gentleman of judgment and discernment Does it not occur to you that I am several thousand times greater than any WoggleBug you ever saw before Therefore it is plainly evident that I am Highly Magnified and there is no good reason why you should doubt the fact Pardon me returned the Scarecrow My brains are slightly mixed since I was last laundered Would it be improper for me to ask also what the TE at the end of your name stands for 144 Those letters express my degree answered the WoggleBug with a condescending smile To be more explicit the initials mean that I am Thoroughly Educated Oh said the Scarecrow much relieved Tip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage What he saw was a great round buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in delicate feetthe toes curling upward The body of the WoggleBug was rather flat and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening dark brown color upon the back while the front was striped with alternate bands of light brown and white blending together at the edges Its arms were fully as slender as its legs and upon a rather long neck was perched its headnot unlike the head of a man except that its nose ended in a curling antenna or feeler and its ears from the upper points bore antennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature curling pig tails It must be admitted that the round black eyes were rather bulging in appearance but the expression upon the WoggleBugs face was by no means unpleasant For dress the insect wore a darkblue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk lining and a flower in the buttonhole a vest of white duck that stretched 145 tightly across the wide body knickerbockers of fawncolored plush fastened at the knees with gilt buckles and perched upon its small head was jauntily set a tall silk hat Standing upright before our amazed friends the WoggleBug appeared to be fully as tall as the Tin Woodman and surely no bug in all the Land of Oz had ever before attained so enormous a size I confess said the Scarecrow that your abrupt appearance has caused me surprise and no doubt has startled my companions I hope however that this circumstance will not distress you We shall probably get used to you in time Do not apologize I beg of you returned the WoggleBug earnestly It affords me great pleasure to surprise people for surely I cannot be classed with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and admiration from those I meet You are indeed agreed his Majesty If you will permit me to seat myself in your august company continued the stranger I will gladly relate my history so that you will be better able to comprehend my unusualmay I say remarkableappearance You may say what you please answered the Tin Woodman briefly 146 So the WoggleBug sat down upon the grass facing the little group of wanderers and told them the following story LineArt Drawing 147 A Highly Magnified History It is but honest that I should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital that I was born an ordinary WoggleBug began the creature in a frank and friendly tone Knowing no better I used my arms as well as my legs for walking and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to feed upon The chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless for I wore no clothing but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me to activity A horrible existence is this but you must remember it is the regular ordained existence of WoggleBugs as well as of many other tiny creatures that inhabit the earth But Destiny had singled me out humble though I was for a grander fate One day I crawled near 148 to a country school house and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous hum of the students within I made bold to enter and creep along a crack between two boards until I reached the far end where in front of a hearth of glowing embers sat the master at his desk No one noticed so small a creature as a WoggleBug and when I found that the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine I resolved to establish my future home beside it So I found a charming nest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many many months Professor Nowitall is doubtless the most famous scholar in the land of Oz and after a few days I began to listen to the lectures and discourses he gave his pupils Not one of them was more attentive than the humble unnoticed WoggleBug and I acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that I will myself confess is simply marvelous That is why I place TE Thoroughly Educated upon my cards for my greatest pride lies in
