crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit drawing the buggy and its occupants after him Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same The sudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think Blackness engulfed them on every side and in breathless silence they waited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for the earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its dreadful depths The horrible sensation of falling the darkness and the terrifying noises proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the little girl lost consciousness Zeb being a boy did not faint but he was badly frightened and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip expecting every moment would be his last 2 The Glass City When Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling but not so fast The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an umbrella filled with wind and held them back so that they floated downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great crack in the earth and the natural fear that sudden death was about to overtake them at any moment Crash after crash echoed far above their heads as the earth came together where it had split and stones and chunks of clay rattled around them on every side These they could not see but they could feel them pelting the buggy top and Jim screamed almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck his boney body They did not really hurt the poor horse because everything was falling together only the stones and rubbish fell faster than the horse and buggy which were held back by the pressure of the air so that the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he was injured How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess she was so greatly bewildered But bye and bye as she stared ahead into the black chasm with a beating heart she began to dimly see the form of the horse Jimhis head up in the air his ears erect and his long legs sprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space Also turning her head she found that she could see the boy beside her who had until now remained as still and silent as she herself Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier She began to realize that death was not in store for her after all but that she had merely started upon another adventure which promised to be just as queer and unusual as were those she had before encountered With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air The central and largest one was white and reminded her of the sun Around it were arranged like the five points of a star the other five brilliant balls one being rose colored one violet one yellow one blue and one orange This splendid group of colored suns sent rays darting in every direction and as the horse and buggywith Dorothy and Zebsank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights the rays began to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow growing more and more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly illuminated Dorothy was too dazed to say much but she watched one of Jims big ears turn to violet and the other to rose and wondered that his tail should be yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of a zebra Then she looked at Zeb whose face was blue and whose hair was pink and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous Isnt it funny she said The boy was startled and his eyes were big Dorothy had a green streak through the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came together and her appearance seemed to add to his fright II dont sssee anything funnybout it he stammered Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side the body of the horse tipping also But they continued to fall all together and the boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat just as they were before Then they turned bottom side up and continued to roll slowly over until they were right side up again During this time Jim struggled frantically all his legs kicking the air but on finding himself in his former position the horse said in a relieved tone of voice Well thats better Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder Can your horse talk she asked Never knew him to before replied the boy Those were the first words I ever said called out the horse who had overheard them and I cant explain why I happened to speak then This is a nice scrape youve got me into isnt it As for that we are in the same scrape ourselves answered Dorothy cheerfully But never mind something will happen pretty soon Of course growled the horse and then we shall be sorry it happened Zeb gave a shiver All this
