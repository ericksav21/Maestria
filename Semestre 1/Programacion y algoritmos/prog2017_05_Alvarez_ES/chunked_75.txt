ainder of the powder 198 Now said he keep silence while I work the charm Having heard old Mombi pronounce the magic words and having also succeeded in bringing the SawHorse to life Tip did not hesitate an instant in speaking the three cabalistic words each accompanied by the peculiar gesture of the hands It was a grave and impressive ceremony As he finished the incantation the Thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk the Gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals and then the four wings began flopping furiously Tip managed to grasp a chimney else he would have been blown off the roof by the terrible breeze raised by the wings The Scarecrow being light in weight was caught up bodily and borne through the air until Tip luckily seized him by one leg and held him fast The WoggleBug lay flat upon the roof and so escaped harm LineArt Drawing 199 and the Tin Woodman whose weight of tin anchored him firmly threw both arms around Jack Pumpkinhead and managed to save him The SawHorse toppled over upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him And now while all were struggling to recover themselves the Thing rose slowly from the roof and mounted into the air Here Come back cried Tip in a frightened voice as he clung to the chimney with one hand and the Scarecrow with the other Come back at once I command you It was now that the wisdom of the Scarecrow in bringing the head of the Thing to life instead of the legs was proved beyond a doubt For the Gump already high in the air turned its head at Tips command and gradually circled around until it could view the roof of the palace Come back shouted the boy again And the Gump obeyed slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air until the Thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still 200 Full page lineart drawing 201 In the Jackdaws Nest This said the Gump in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned to the size of its great body is the most novel experience I ever heard of The last thing I remember distinctly is walking through the forest and hearing a loud noise Something probably killed me then and it certainly ought to have been the end of me Yet here I am alive again with four monstrous wings and a body which I venture to say would make any respectable animal or fowl weep with shame to own What does it all mean Am I a Gump or am I a juggernaut The creature as it spoke wiggled its chin whiskers in a very comical manner Youre just a Thing answered Tip with a Gumps head on it And we have made you and brought you to life so that you may carry us through the air wherever we wish to go 202 Very good said the Thing As I am not a Gump I cannot have a Gumps pride or independent spirit So I may as well become your servant as anything else My only satisfaction is that I do not seem to have a very strong constitution and am not likely to live long in a state of slavery Dont say that I beg of you cried the Tin Woodman whose excellent heart was strongly affected by this sad speech Are you not feeling well today Oh as for that returned the Gump it is my first day of existence so I cannot Judge whether I am feeling well or ill And it waved its broom tail to and fro in a pensive manner Come come said the Scarecrow kindly do try to be more cheerful and take life as you find it We shall be kind masters and will strive to render your existence as pleasant as possible Are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go Certainly answered the Gump I greatly prefer to navigate the air For should I travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species my embarrassment would be something awful I can appreciate that said the Tin Woodman sympathetically And yet continued the Thing when I carefully 203 look you over my masters none of you seems to be constructed much more artistically than I am Appearances are deceitful said the WoggleBug earnestly I am both Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated Indeed murmured the Gump indifferently And my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens added the Scarecrow proudly How strange remarked the Gump Although I am of tin said the Woodman I own a heart altogether the warmest and most admirable in the whole world Im delighted to hear it replied the Gump with a slight cough My smile said Jack Pumpkinhead is worthy your best attention It is always the same Semper idem explained the WoggleBug pompously and the Gump turned to stare at him And I declared the SawHorse filling in an awkward pause am only remarkable because I cant help it I am proud indeed to meet with such exceptional masters said the Gump in a careless tone If I could but secure so complete an introduction to myself I would be more than satisfied That will come in time remarked the Scare 204 crow To Know Thyself is considered quite an accomplishment which it has taken us who are your elders months to perfect But now he added turning to the others let us get aboard and start upon our journey Where shall we go asked Tip
