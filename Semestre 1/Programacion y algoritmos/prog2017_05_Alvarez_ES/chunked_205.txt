 to their hearts content Walking beyond the line of trees they saw before them a fearful dismal desert everywhere gray sand At the edge of this awful waste was a large white sign with black letters neatly painted upon it and the letters made these words ALL PERSONS ARE WARNED NOT TO VENTURE UPON THIS DESERT For the Deadly Sands will Turn Any Living Flesh to Dust in an instant Beyond This Barrier is the LAND OF OZ But no one can Reach that Beautiful Country because of these Destroying Sands Oh said Dorothy when the shaggy man had read the sign aloud Ive seen this desert before and its true no one can live who tries to walk upon the sands Then we musnt try it answered the shaggy man thoughtfully But as we cant go ahead and theres no use going back what shall we do next Dont know said ButtonBright Im sure I dont know either added Dorothy despondently I wish father would come for me sighed the pretty Rainbows Daughter I would take you all to live upon the rainbow where you could dance along its rays from morning till night without a care or worry of any sort But I suppose fathers too busy just now to search the world for me Dont want to dance said ButtonBright sitting down wearily upon the soft grass Its very good of you Polly said Dorothy but there are other things that would suit me better than dancing on rainbows Im fraid theyd be kind of soft an squashy under foot anyhow although theyre so pretty to look at This didnt help to solve the problem and they all fell silent and looked at one another questioningly Really I dont know what to do muttered the shaggy man gazing hard at Toto and the little dog wagged his tail and said Bowwow just as if he could not tell either what to do ButtonBright got a stick and began to dig in the earth and the others watched him for a while in deep thought Finally the shaggy man said Its nearly evening now so we may as well sleep in this pretty place and get rested perhaps by morning we can decide what is best to be done There was little chance to make beds for the children but the leaves of the trees grew thickly and would serve to keep off the night dews so the shaggy man piled soft grasses in the thickest shade and when it was dark they lay down and slept peacefully until morning Long after the others were asleep however the shaggy man sat in the starlight by the spring gazing thoughtfully into its bubbling waters Suddenly he smiled and nodded to himself as if he had found a good thought after which he too laid himself down under a tree and was soon lost in slumber In the bright morning sunshine as they ate of the strawberries and sweet juicy pears Dorothy said Polly can you do any magic No dear answered Polychrome shaking her dainty head You ought to know SOME magic being the Rainbows Daughter continued Dorothy earnestly But we who live on the rainbow among the fleecy clouds have no use for magic replied Polychrome What Id like said Dorothy is to find some way to cross the desert to the Land of Oz and its Emerald City Ive crossed it already you know more than once First a cyclone carried my house over and some Silver Shoes brought me back againin half a second Then Ozma took me over on her Magic Carpet and the Nome Kings Magic Belt took me home that time You see it was magic that did it every time cept the first and we cant spect a cyclone to happen along and take us to the Emerald City now No indeed returned Polly with a shudder I hate cyclones anyway Thats why I wanted to find out if you could do any magic said the little Kansas girl Im sure I cant and Im sure ButtonBright cant and the only magic the shaggy man has is the Love Magnet which wont help us much Dont be too sure of that my dear spoke the shaggy man a smile on his donkey face I may not be able to do magic myself but I can call to us a powerful friend who loves me because I own the Love Magnet and this friend surely will be able to help us Who is your friend asked Dorothy Johnny Dooit What can Johnny do Anything answered the shaggy man with confidence Ask him to come she exclaimed eagerly The shaggy man took the Love Magnet from his pocket and unwrapped the paper that surrounded it Holding the charm in the palm of his hand he looked at it steadily and said these words Dear Johnny Dooit come to me I need you bad as bad can be Well here I am said a cheery little voice but you shouldnt say you need me bad cause Im always ALWAYS good At this they quickly whirled around to find a funny little man sitting on a big copper chest puffing smoke from a long pipe His hair was grey his whiskers were grey and these whiskers were so long that he had wound the ends of them around his waist and tied them in a hard knot underneath the leather apron that reached from his chin nearly to his feet and which was soiled and scratched as if it had been used a long time His nose was broad and stuck up a little but his eyes were twinkling and merry The little mans hands and arms were as hard and tough as the leather in his apron and Dorothy
