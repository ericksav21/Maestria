ether And dont forget in the course of your journey north if you find a King willing to lend his army my army also will be ready and at your service Oh Kalico how kind you are Running up the steps of the throne again Dorothy gave the Gnome King an impulsive hug Come on COME on squealed Pigasus who had seen the various winks between Kalico and Shoofenwaller and was convinced that the little Gnome King was doing as little as he possibly could Give us our lunch and our stumbling blocks and well be off and I must say theyll be an enormous help when we reach Thunder Mountain Spreading his wings Pigasus began to fly in angry circles round the Gnome Kings head Humph porks going up sniffed Shoofenwaller as he hurried away to see about packing the lunch basket He ought to be dried smoked and salted muttered Potaroo going sulkily off to fetch the blocks Dorothy in earnest consultation with Kalico heard neither of these remarks and when a few moments later the two returned with two boxes and Dorothys hat and coat she thanked them politely called Pigasus down from a rocky ledge where he had flown and climbed happily on his back Then Pigasus not giving her time for any lengthy farewells zipped through the tunneled caverns and corridors of the Gnome Kings Underground Dominions and burst thankfully out the back door of South Mountain Now lets see which way is north mused Pigasus twirling his curly tail around like a propeller All we have to do is to fly north to Thunder Mountain unlock its thunder bolts restore the rulers of Oz toss tumbling blocks at all enemies raise a grand army and then THEN King Kalico will help us Isnt it just too magniferous Why Piggins how mean of you surely you know The Gnome Kings our friend dont you like Kalico No said Pigasus fiercely hurling himself into the air Well anyway were better off than we were before thought Dorothy after several rhymed attempts to draw Pigasus into a conversation At least we now know where Ozma is and have two kinds of magic and the promise of an army Really were getting on quite fast But perhaps had she seen the King and his Chamberlain nodding their heads like two little China mandarins as she and Pigasus left the throne room she would not have felt so cheerful Thats the last well ever see of her chuckled Shoofenwaller dropping a dried lizard instead of a lump of sugar into his tea Gnomes always flavor their tea with lizards No one yet has ever come safely back from Thunder Mountain But what about this new Emperor of Oz Oh that will be all right Kalico waved one hand airily I would much rather have a man on the throne of Oz Ozma is always involving me in wars or demanding the rights of smaller Kingdoms so long may she stay in Thunder Mountain and long Skamperoo rule in Oz Long live the Emperor echoed Shoofenwaller and clicking their teacups gaily together the two bad little Gnomes drained to the last drop their black and bitter tea And we should not be too hard on Kalico I suppose for like all the dwellers under the earth his heart is gray and flinty as the rock that forms his cavern the blood in his veins cold and sluggish as the leaden waters of the underground rivers that wind sullenly through his dark domain CHAPTER 14 THE EMPEROR OF OZ The same morning Dorothy wakened in the rustic summer house of the Winkie farmer Skamperoo opened his eyes upon the unaccustomed grandeur of Ozmas Royal Palace The banquet had lasted till long after three oclock then still chuckling and yawning he had waved goodnight to his hilarious and amiable subjects and led Chalk off to bed Twenty footmen with twenty lighted tapers preceded him to Ozmas own apartment but dismissing this as too plain and simple he had taken the immense green guest suite across the hall Chalk would have much preferred a stall in the Royal Stable with the other fourfooted members of the castle party but Skamperoo would not hear of such a separation He wanted his white wishing horse close at hand not only because through him and the magic emeralds he could satisfy every wish but because for the first time in his long lazy selfish life he had found someone he liked better than himself In Skamperoos eyes Chalk was absolutely perfect and as his own wish had brought the goldenmaned charger into being he felt proud and important as a parent with his first child After a few regretful sniffs out of the window a few short turns up and down their immense and elegant sleeping apartment Chalk leaped lightly on one of the large green beds and settled himself gracefully for the night Covering Chalk tenderly with a green satin quilt Skamperoo hastily disrobed and clutching his precious necklaces climbed wearily into the other bed There without even stopping to wish himself goodnight he fell into a deep and tranquil slumber Indeed both in spite of the strangeness of their surroundings slept soundly till morning About eight oclock Chalk lifting his head from the embroidered pillow looked indulgently across at the new Emperor
