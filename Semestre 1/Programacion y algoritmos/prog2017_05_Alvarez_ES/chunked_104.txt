 Tiktok approached them with his stiff bow Be kind enough to follow me he said and I will lead you away from here to the town of Evna where you will be more comfortable and also I will protect you from the Wheelers All right answered Dorothy promptly Im ready 6 The Heads of Langwidere They walked slowly down the path between the rocks Tiktok going first Dorothy following him and the yellow hen trotting along last of all At the foot of the path the copper man leaned down and tossed aside with ease the rocks that encumbered the way Then he turned to Dorothy and said Let me carry your dinnerpail She placed it in his right hand at once and the copper fingers closed firmly over the stout handle Then the little procession marched out upon the level sands As soon as the three Wheelers who were guarding the mound saw them they began to shout their wild cries and rolled swiftly toward the little group as if to capture them or bar their way But when the foremost had approached near enough Tiktok swung the tin dinnerpail and struck the Wheeler a sharp blow over its head with the queer weapon Perhaps it did not hurt very much but it made a great noise and the Wheeler uttered a howl and tumbled over upon its side The next minute it scrambled to its wheels and rolled away as fast as it could go screeching with fear at the same time I told you they were harmless began Tiktok but before he could say more another Wheeler was upon them Crack went the dinnerpail against its head knocking its straw hat a dozen feet away and that was enough for this Wheeler also It rolled away after the first one and the third did not wait to be pounded with the pail but joined its fellows as quickly as its wheels would whirl The yellow hen gave a cackle of delight and flying to a perch upon Tiktoks shoulder she said Bravely done my copper friend and wisely thought of too Now we are free from those ugly creatures But just then a large band of Wheelers rolled from the forest and relying upon their numbers to conquer they advanced fiercely upon Tiktok Dorothy grabbed Billina in her arms and held her tight and the machine embraced the form of the little girl with his left arm the better to protect her Then the Wheelers were upon them Rattlety bang bang went the dinnerpail in every direction and it made so much clatter bumping against the heads of the Wheelers that they were much more frightened than hurt and fled in a great panic All that is except their leader This Wheeler had stumbled against another and fallen flat upon his back and before he could get his wheels under him to rise again Tiktok had fastened his copper fingers into the neck of the gorgeous jacket of his foe and held him fast Tell your people to go away commanded the machine The leader of the Wheelers hesitated to give this order so Tiktok shook him as a terrier dog does a rat until the Wheelers teeth rattled together with a noise like hailstones on a window pane Then as soon as the creature could get its breath it shouted to the others to roll away which they immediately did Now said Tiktok you shall come with us and tell me what I want to know Youll be sorry for treating me in this way whined the Wheeler Im a terribly fierce person As for that answered Tiktok I am only a machine and cannot feel sorrow or joy no matter what happens But you are wrong to think yourself terrible or fierce Why so asked the Wheeler Because no one else thinks as you do Your wheels make you helpless to injure any one For you have no fists and can not scratch or even pull hair Nor have you any feet to kick with All you can do is to yell and shout and that does not hurt any one at all The Wheeler burst into a flood of tears to Dorothys great surprise Now I and my people are ruined forever he sobbed for you have discovered our secret Being so helpless our only hope is to make people afraid of us by pretending we are very fierce and terrible and writing in the sand warnings to Beware the Wheelers Until now we have frightened everyone but since you have discovered our weakness our enemies will fall upon us and make us very miserable and unhappy Oh no exclaimed Dorothy who was sorry to see this beautifully dressed Wheeler so miserable Tiktok will keep your secret and so will Billina and I Only you must promise not to try to frighten children any more if they come near to you I wontindeed I wont promised the Wheeler ceasing to cry and becoming more cheerful Im not really bad you know but we have to pretend to be terrible in order to prevent others from attacking us That is not exactly true said Tiktok starting to walk toward the path through the forest and still holding fast to his prisoner who rolled slowly along beside him You and your people are full of mischief and like to bother those who fear you And you are often impudent and disagreeable too But if you will try to cure those faults I will not tell anyone how helpless you are Ill try of course replied the Wheeler eagerly And thank you Mr Tiktok for your
