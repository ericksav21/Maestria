n remarked Langwidere I will not fry the hen but keep her to lay eggs and if she doesnt do her duty Ill have her drowned in the horse trough 7 Ozma of Oz to the Rescue Nanda brought Dorothy bread and water for her supper and she slept upon a hard stone couch with a single pillow and a silken coverlet In the morning she leaned out of the window of her prison in the tower to see if there was any way to escape The room was not so very high up when compared with our modern buildings but it was far enough above the trees and farm houses to give her a good view of the surrounding country To the east she saw the forest with the sands beyond it and the ocean beyond that There was even a dark speck upon the shore that she thought might be the chickencoop in which she had arrived at this singular country Then she looked to the north and saw a deep but narrow valley lying between two rocky mountains and a third mountain that shut off the valley at the further end Westward the fertile Land of Ev suddenly ended a little way from the palace and the girl could see miles and miles of sandy desert that stretched further than her eyes could reach It was this desert she thought with much interest that alone separated her from the wonderful Land of Oz and she remembered sorrowfully that she had been told no one had ever been able to cross this dangerous waste but herself Once a cyclone had carried her across it and a magical pair of silver shoes had carried her back again But now she had neither a cyclone nor silver shoes to assist her and her condition was sad indeed For she had become the prisoner of a disagreeable princess who insisted that she must exchange her head for another one that she was not used to and which might not fit her at all Really there seemed no hope of help for her from her old friends in the Land of Oz Thoughtfully she gazed from her narrow window On all the desert not a living thing was stirring Wait though Something surely WAS stirring on the desertsomething her eyes had not observed at first Now it seemed like a cloud now it seemed like a spot of silver now it seemed to be a mass of rainbow colors that moved swiftly toward her What COULD it be she wondered Then gradually but in a brief space of time nevertheless the vision drew near enough to Dorothy to make out what it was A broad green carpet was unrolling itself upon the desert while advancing across the carpet was a wonderful procession that made the girl open her eyes in amazement as she gazed First came a magnificent golden chariot drawn by a great Lion and an immense Tiger who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted along as gracefully as a wellmatched team of thoroughbred horses And standing upright within the chariot was a beautiful girl clothed in flowing robes of silver gauze and wearing a jeweled diadem upon her dainty head She held in one hand the satin ribbons that guided her astonishing team and in the other an ivory wand that separated at the top into two prongs the prongs being tipped by the letters O and Z made of glistening diamonds set closely together The girl seemed neither older nor larger than Dorothy herself and at once the prisoner in the tower guessed that the lovely driver of the chariot must be that Ozma of Oz of whom she had so lately heard from Tiktok Following close behind the chariot Dorothy saw her old friend the Scarecrow riding calmly astride a wooden SawHorse which pranced and trotted as naturally as any meat horse could have done And then came Nick Chopper the Tin Woodman with his funnelshaped cap tipped carelessly over his left ear his gleaming axe over his right shoulder and his whole body sparkling as brightly as it had ever done in the old days when first she knew him The Tin Woodman was on foot marching at the head of a company of twentyseven soldiers of whom some were lean and some fat some short and some tall but all the twentyseven were dressed in handsome uniforms of various designs and colors no two being alike in any respect Behind the soldiers the green carpet rolled itself up again so that there was always just enough of it for the procession to walk upon in order that their feet might not come in contact with the deadly lifedestroying sands of the desert Dorothy knew at once it was a magic carpet she beheld and her heart beat high with hope and joy as she realized she was soon to be rescued and allowed to greet her dearly beloved friends of Ozthe Scarecrow the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion Indeed the girl felt herself as good as rescued as soon as she recognized those in the procession for she well knew the courage and loyalty of her old comrades and also believed that any others who came from their marvelous country would prove to be pleasant and reliable acquaintances As soon as the last bit of desert was passed and all the procession from the beautiful and dainty Ozma to the last soldier had reached the grassy meadows of the Land of Ev the magic carpet rolled itself together and entirely disap
