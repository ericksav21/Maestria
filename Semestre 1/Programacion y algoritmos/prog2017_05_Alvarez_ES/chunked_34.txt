 Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her This is the second time you have called us said the Monkey King bowing before the little girl What do you wish I want you to fly with me to Kansas said Dorothy But the Monkey King shook his head That cannot be done he said We belong to this country alone and cannot leave it There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet and I suppose there never will be for they dont belong there We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert Goodbye And with another bow the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose she said for the Winged Monkeys cannot help me It is certainly too bad said the tenderhearted Woodman The Scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers he said and ask his advice So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly for while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door This little girl said the Scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert How can she do so I cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the desert unless it is Oz himself Is there no one who can help me asked Dorothy earnestly Glinda might he suggested Who is Glinda inquired the Scarecrow The Witch of the South She is the most powerful of all the Witches and rules over the Quadlings Besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it Glinda is a Good Witch isnt she asked the child The Quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived How can I get to her castle asked Dorothy The road is straight to the South he answered but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers There are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said It seems in spite of dangers that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her For of course if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas You must have been thinking again remarked the Tin Woodman I have said the Scarecrow I shall go with Dorothy declared the Lion for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again I am really a wild beast you know Besides Dorothy will need someone to protect her That is true agreed the Woodman My axe may be of service to her so I also will go with her to the Land of the South When shall we start asked the Scarecrow Are you going they asked in surprise Certainly If it wasnt for Dorothy I should never have had brains She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City So my good luck is all due to her and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all Thank you said Dorothy gratefully You are all very kind to me But I should like to start as soon as possible We shall go tomorrow morning returned the Scarecrow So now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey 19 Attacked by the Fighting Trees The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl goodbye and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble But he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to carry with them You are now our ruler he said to the Scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible I certainly shall if I am able the Scarecrow replied but I must help Dorothy to get home first As Dorothy bade the goodnatured Guardian a last farewell she said I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City and everyone has been good to me I cannot tell you how grateful I am Dont try my dear he answered We should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to Kansas I hope you will find a way He then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South They were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her As for the Lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily
