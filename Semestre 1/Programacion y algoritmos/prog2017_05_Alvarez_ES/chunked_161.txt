ppeared in their land In turn the Wizard and the children the horse and the kitten examined the Gargoyles with the same silent attention Theres going to be trouble Im sure remarked the horse Unhitch those tugs Zeb and set me free from the buggy so I can fight comfortably Jims right sighed the Wizard Theres going to be trouble and my sword isnt stout enough to cut up those wooden bodiesso I shall have to get out my revolvers He got his satchel from the buggy and opening it took out two deadly looking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to look at What harm can the Gurgles do asked Dorothy They have no weapons to hurt us with Each of their arms is a wooden club answered the little man and Im sure the creatures mean mischief by the looks of their eyes Even these revolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies and after that we will be at their mercy But why fight at all in that case asked the girl So I may die with a clear conscience returned the Wizard gravely Its every mans duty to do the best he knows how and Im going to do it Wish I had an axe said Zeb who by now had unhitched the horse If we had known we were coming we might have brought along several other useful things responded the Wizard But we dropped into this adventure rather unexpectedly The Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound of talking for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words seemed loud in the silence surrounding them But as soon as the conversation ceased the grinning ugly creatures arose in a flock and flew swiftly toward the strangers their long arms stretched out before them like the bowsprits of a fleet of sailboats The horse had especially attracted their notice because it was the biggest and strangest creature they had ever seen so it became the center of their first attack But Jim was ready for them and when he saw them coming he turned his heels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could Crack crash bang went his ironshod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the Gargoyles and they were battered right and left with such force that they scattered like straws in the wind But the noise and clatter seemed as dreadful to them as Jims heels for all who were able swiftly turned and flew away to a great distance The others picked themselves up from the ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows so for a moment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease But the Wizard was not so confident Those wooden things are impossible to hurt he said and all the damage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their noses and ears That cannot make them look any uglier Im sure and it is my opinion they will soon renew the attack What made them fly away asked Dorothy The noise of course Dont you remember how the Champion escaped them by shouting his battlecry Suppose we escape down the stairs too suggested the boy We have time just now and Id rather face the invisble bears than those wooden imps No returned Dorothy stoutly it wont do to go back for then we would never get home Lets fight it out That is what I advise said the Wizard They havent defeated us yet and Jim is worth a whole army But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next time They advanced in a great swarm having been joined by many more of their kind and they flew straight over Jims head to where the others were standing The Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his enemies and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent place Some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground where they quivered and trembled in every limb but most of them managed to wheel and escape again to a distance Zeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him The top of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizards bullet had struck it exactly in the left eye which was a hard wooden knot Half of the bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out so it had been the jar and the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down more than the fact that it was really hurt Before this crowned Gargoyle had recovered himself Zeb had wound a strap several times around its body confining its wings and arms so that it could not move Then having tied the wooden creature securely the boy buckled the strap and tossed his prisoner into the buggy By that time the others had all retired 12 A Wonderful Escape For a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack Then a few of them advanced until another shot from the Wizards revolver made them retreat Thats fine said Zeb Weve got em on the run now sure enough But only for a time replied the Wizard shaking his head gloomily These revolvers are good for six shots each but when those are gone we shall be helpless The Gargoyles seemed to realize this for they sent a few of their band time after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from the little mans revolvers In this way none
