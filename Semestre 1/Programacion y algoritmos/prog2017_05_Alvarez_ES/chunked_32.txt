ed But is it a kind heart Oh very answered Oz He put the heart in the Woodmans breast and then replaced the square of tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut There said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of Im sorry I had to put a patch on your breast but it really couldnt be helped Never mind the patch exclaimed the happy Woodman I am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness Dont speak of it replied Oz Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door Come in said Oz I have come for my courage announced the Lion entering the room Very well answered the little man I will get it for you He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a greengold dish beautifully carved Placing this before the Cowardly Lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the Wizard said Drink What is it asked the Lion Well answered Oz if it were inside of you it would be courage You know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible The Lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty How do you feel now asked Oz Full of courage replied the Lion who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune Oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted How can I help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows cant be done It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy because they imagined I could do anything But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas and Im sure I dont know how it can be done 17 How the Balloon Was Launched For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz These were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas On the fourth day to her great joy Oz sent for her and when she entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly Sit down my dear I think I have found the way to get you out of this country And back to Kansas she asked eagerly Well Im not sure about Kansas said Oz for I havent the faintest notion which way it lies But the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way home How can I cross the desert she inquired Well Ill tell you what I think said the little man You see when I came to this country it was in a balloon You also came through the air being carried by a cyclone So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air Now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone but Ive been thinking the matter over and I believe I can make a balloon How asked Dorothy A balloon said Oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it I have plenty of silk in the Palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float If it wont float remarked Dorothy it will be of no use to us True answered Oz But there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air Hot air isnt as good as gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost We exclaimed the girl Are you going with me Yes of course replied Oz I am tired of being such a humbug If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome Id much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again I shall be glad to have your company said Dorothy Thank you he answered Now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon So Dorothy took a needle and thread and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together First there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them It took three days to sew all the strips together bu
