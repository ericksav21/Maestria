ock of Jackdaws approached to engage in one more battle for the possession of the nest But our adventurers did not wait for the assault They tumbled into the cushioned seats of the sofas as quickly as possible and Tip gave the word to the Gump to start At once it rose into the air the great wings flopping strongly and with regular motions and in a few moments they were so far from the nest that the chattering Jackdaws took possession without any attempt at pursuit The Thing flew due North going in the same direction from whence it had come At least that was the Scarecrows opinion and the others agreed that the Scarecrow was the best judge of direction After passing over several cities and villages the Gump carried them high above a broad plain where houses became more and more scattered until they 234 disappeared altogether Next came the wide sandy desert separating the rest of the world from the Land of Oz and before noon they saw the domeshaped houses that proved they were once more within the borders of their native land But the houses and fences are blue said the Tin Woodman and that indicates we are in the land of the Munchkins and therefore a long distance from Glinda the Good What shall we do asked the boy turning to their guide I dont know replied the Scarecrow frankly If we were at the Emerald City we could then move directly southward and so reach our destination But we dare not go to the Emerald City and the Gump is probably carrying us further in the wrong direction with every flop of its wings Then the WoggleBug must swallow another pill said Tip decidedly and wish us headed in the right direction Very well returned the Highly Magnified one Im willing But when the Scarecrow searched in his pocket for the pepperbox containing the two silver Wishing Pills it was not to be found Filled with anxiety the voyagers hunted throughout every inch of the 235 Thing for the precious box but it had disappeared entirely And still the Gump flew onward carrying them they knew not where I must have left the pepperbox in the Jackdaws nest said the Scarecrow at length It is a great misfortune the Tin Woodman declared But we are no worse off than before we discovered the Wishing Pills We are better off replied Tip for the one pill we used has enabled us to escape from that horrible nest Yet the loss of the other two is serious and I deserve a good scolding for my carelessness the Scarecrow rejoined penitently For in such an unusual party as this accidents are liable to happen any moment and even now we may be approaching a new danger No one dared contradict this and a dismal silence ensued The Gump flew steadily on Suddenly Tip uttered an exclamation of surprise We must have reached the South Country he cried for below us everything is red Immediately they all leaned over the backs of the sofas to lookall except Jack who was too careful 236 of his pumpkin head to risk its slipping off his neck Sure enough the red houses and fences and trees indicated they were within the domain of Glinda the Good and presently as they glided rapidly on the Tin Woodman recognized the roads and buildings they passed and altered slightly the flight of LineArt Drawing 237 the Gump so that they might reach the palace of the celebrated Sorceress Good cried the Scarecrow delightedly We do not need the lost Wishing Pills now for we have arrived at our destination Gradually the Thing sank lower and nearer to the ground until at length it came to rest within the beautiful gardens of Glinda settling upon a velvety green lawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing gems instead of water high into the air whence they fell with a soft tinkling sound into the carved marble basin placed to receive them Everything was very gorgeous in Glindas gardens and while our voyagers gazed about with admiring eyes a company of soldiers silently appeared and surrounded them But these soldiers of the great Sorceress were entirely different from those of Jinjurs Army of Revolt although they were likewise girls For Glindas soldiers wore neat uniforms and bore swords and spears and they marched with a skill and precision that proved them well trained in the arts of war The Captain commanding this troopwhich was Glindas private Body Guardrecognized the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman at once and greeted them with respectful salutations 238 Good day said the Scarecrow gallantly removing his hat while the Woodman gave a soldierly salute we have come to request an audience with your fair Ruler Glinda is now within her palace awaiting you returned the Captain for she saw you coming long before you arrived That is strange said Tip wondering Not at all answered the Scarecrow for Glinda the Good is a mighty Sorceress and nothing that goes on in the Land of Oz escapes her notice I suppose she knows why we came as well as we do ourselves Then what was the use of our coming asked Jack stupidly To prove you are a Pumpkinhead retorted the Scarecrow But if the Sorceress
