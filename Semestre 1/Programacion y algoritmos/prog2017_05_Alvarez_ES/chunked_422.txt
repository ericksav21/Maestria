 or clump of bushes where she could examine the contents of the Wizards bag without interruption So anxious was Jellia to be by herself she broke into a run Failing to notice a crystal bar stretched across the path she tripped and fell violently up a tune tree Falling down is bad enough but falling up is worse still Jellia not only had barked her shins on the crystal bar but had bounced into the air so high she lost her breath and plunged down so abruptly among the top branches of the tune tree that she was somewhat scratched and shaken She knew it must be a tune tree because plump black notes grew in clusters like cherries between the leaves Several dislodged by her fall broke into gay little arias and chords At any other time Jellia would have been quite interested but now she was too agitated and upset to care Such a country C4 or airtry groaned the Oz maid rubbing her left ankle and her right knee One cant even fall down in their own way Parting the branches the ruffled little girl looked crossly out It was quite a long way to the ground but nevertheless Jellia decided to climb down But suddenly it occurred to her that the top of the tune tree was as good a place as any to open the kitbag Easing herself to a larger limb she balanced the bag carefully in her lap and stretched out her hand to pull the tail Then a piercing scream and the thump of a hundred footsteps made her draw it back in a hurry Parting the branches of the tree for a second time she saw Wantowin Battles running toward her like the wind Help Help Save me yelled the Soldier with Green Whiskers And he had reason to yell for just two leaps behind him panted Kabebe waving an enormous crystal rolling pin After the Queen pounded the three big Blowmen and after the Blowmen came nearly a hundred men women and children Before Jellia had time even to guess why they were chasing the Army Wantowin tripped over the same crystal bar that had caused her upfall and landed with a terrific grunt in the branches beside her scattering half and quarternotes in every direction The Airlanders stopped short and watched with breathless interest as the Soldier disappeared into the thick foliage of the tune tree Whats the matter What happened whispered Jellia reaching out to steady the soldier who was bouncing wildly up and down on a nearby limb YOU gasped Wantowin almost losing his balance at the shock of seeing her Oh Jellia We must leave at once AT ONCE As I was passing the cooking caves Kabebe rushed out and grabbed me She has decided to blow us away most any minute now She has persuaded the Airlanders that Strut is lost and never will return Oh why WHY did we ever fly to this terrible place Be quiet hissed Jellia frightened almost out of her wits at this new turn of affairs How can I think with you making all that noise Come down Come down bawled Kabebe Come down before I shake you down Grasping the trunk of the tune tree she gave it a playful shake You might as well go down she whispered resignedly as the Queen gave the tree a tremendous shake that nearly dislodged them both Not without you shivered Wantowin hugging his branch for dear life Oh well lets get it over with said Jellia despairingly Blowing away may not be so bad and Id rather do anything than stay up here Tucking the kitbag under one arm Jellia swung herself down by the other and dropped lightly to the ground What is the meaning of this outrageous behavior she demanded as Wantowin dropped fearfully beside her His Majesty shall hear of this I promise you Kabebe astonished to see Jellia as well as the Soldier with Green Whiskers drop out of the tree took a hasty step backward Jellia quickly followed up her advantage Im amazed she said sternly I thought you knew that I was to help you rule while King Strut is away At this bold speech Wantowin looked at Jellia in roundeyed admiration Though her cheeks were scratched and her crown slightly askew the little Waiting Maid looked every inch a rulers helper if not a ruler Even the Blowmen began to shift uneasily from one foot to the other their mouths falling open at Jellias indignation But Kabebe raised both arms and fairly screeched at the little Oz Maid How dare you speak to me like that she shrieked King Strut is lost and never will return I am Queen here and I dont need your help Blowmen Seize this impudent pair march them to the edge of the cliffs and blow them away The crowd of Stratovanians looked uncertainly from Kabebe to Jellia His Highness left you here to protect me Jellia reminded them sternly But even as she spoke she knew they had decided to obey Kabebe She was flashing her star eyes so threateningly and waving her winged stick to close to their heads that the Blowmen were afraid to defy her Come along now grumbled the first Blowman taking Jellia roughly by the arm Youve caused enough trouble here The other two Blowmen seized the trembling Soldier and began marching sternly toward the edge of Struts Skyland Jellia pulled back with all her
