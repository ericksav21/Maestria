rs and trotted back where they had left the shaggy man From here he started along another road then came back and tried another but each time he found the way strange and decided it would not take them to the farmhouse Finally when Dorothy had begun to tire with chasing after him Toto sat down panting beside the shaggy man and gave up Dorothy sat down too very thoughtful The little girl had encountered some queer adventures since she came to live at the farm but this was the queerest of them all To get lost in fifteen minutes so near to her home and in the unromantic State of Kansas was an experience that fairly bewildered her Will your folks worry asked the shaggy man his eyes twinkling in a pleasant way I spose so answered Dorothy with a sigh Uncle Henry says theres ALWAYS something happening to me but Ive always come home safe at the last So perhaps hell take comfort and think Ill come home safe this time Im sure you will said the shaggy man smilingly nodding at her Good little girls never come to any harm you know For my part Im good too so nothing ever hurts me Dorothy looked at him curiously His clothes were shaggy his boots were shaggy and full of holes and his hair and whiskers were shaggy But his smile was sweet and his eyes were kind Why didnt you want to go to Butterfield she asked Because a man lives there who owes me fifteen cents and if I went to Butterfield and he saw me hed want to pay me the money I dont want money my dear Why not she inquired Money declared the shaggy man makes people proud and haughty I dont want to be proud and haughty All I want is to have people love me and as long as I own the Love Magnet everyone I meet is sure to love me dearly The Love Magnet Why whats that Ill show you if you wont tell any one he answered in a low mysterious voice There isnt any one to tell cept Toto said the girl The shaggy man searched in one pocket carefully and in another pocket and in a third At last he drew out a small parcel wrapped in crumpled paper and tied with a cotton string He unwound the string opened the parcel and took out a bit of metal shaped like a horseshoe It was dull and brown and not very pretty This my dear said he impressively is the wonderful Love Magnet It was given me by an Eskimo in the Sandwich Islandswhere there are no sandwiches at alland as long as I carry it every living thing I meet will love me dearly Why didnt the Eskimo keep it she asked looking at the Magnet with interest He got tired of being loved and longed for some one to hate him So he gave me the Magnet and the very next day a grizzly bear ate him Wasnt he sorry then she inquired He didnt say replied the shaggy man wrapping and tying the Love Magnet with great care and putting it away in another pocket But the bear didnt seem sorry a bit he added Did you know the bear asked Dorothy Yes we used to play ball together in the Caviar Islands The bear loved me because I had the Love Magnet I couldnt blame him for eating the Eskimo because it was his nature to do so Once said Dorothy I knew a Hungry Tiger who longed to eat fat babies because it was his nature to but he never ate any because he had a Conscience This bear replied the shaggy man with a sigh had no Conscience you see The shaggy man sat silent for several minutes apparently considering the cases of the bear and the tiger while Toto watched him with an air of great interest The little dog was doubtless thinking of his ride in the shaggy mans pocket and planning to keep out of reach in the future At last the shaggy man turned and inquired Whats your name little girl My names Dorothy said she jumping up again but what are we going to do We cant stay here forever you know Lets take the seventh road he suggested Seven is a lucky number for little girls named Dorothy The seventh from where From where you begin to count So she counted seven roads and the seventh looked just like all the others but the shaggy man got up from the ground where he had been sitting and started down this road as if sure it was the best way to go and Dorothy and Toto followed him 2 Dorothy Meets ButtonBright The seventh road was a good road and curved this way and thatwinding through green meadows and fields covered with daisies and buttercups and past groups of shady trees There were no houses of any sort to be seen and for some distance they met with no living creature at all Dorothy began to fear they were getting a good way from the farmhouse since here everything was strange to her but it would do no good at all to go back where the other roads all met because the next one they chose might lead her just as far from home She kept on beside the shaggy man who whistled cheerful tunes to beguile the journey until by and by they followed a turn in the road and saw before them a big chestnut tree making a shady spot over the highway In the shade sat a little boy dressed in sailor clothes who was digging a hole in the earth with a bit of wood He must have been digging some time be
