be sorry for us for here we have been perfectly happy and content and I have grown so fond of my black forest and castle I would not change their lovely sable for all the other colors in the rainbow But tell me quickly again all that has happened in Oz and perhaps I can make amends for the shabby treatment you have received at our hands Contritely the Black Queen leaned down to pat Pigasus and as Dorothy sketched in most of the important happenings in Oz since the reign of the Wizard the little pig pressed closely against her side With many interested nods and exclamations Gloma listened and when Dorothy described the great festival that had been planned to celebrate the discovery of Oz by mortals how Ozma and all her most important visitors and advisers had vanished at the banquet and a false Emperor taken possession of the palace the Queen rose and walked solemnly over to the black crystal But after a long look into its inky depths Gloma turned sadly away My black magic cannot help you she told them regretfully The rulers of Oz and your other friends have been enchanted by green magic and only by green magic can they be released and restored to power But I can assist you in other ways added the Queen noting the disappointed expressions on the faces of her two new friends One tap of my scepter will transport you to any country and hereFF20C4 from a drawer in the ebony table the Queen drew a small black round box C4FF20in this container you will find a most powerful powder of darkness One pinch of this powder tossed into the air will cause a black cloud a mile square to envelop and totally darken a city or country While no one in this darkened area will be able to see you it will be perfectly possible for you to see them as clearly as in the usual daylight In case of danger it affords a safe way of escape from the enemy To dispel the cloud you merely close the box That ought to be just the thing to use if we ever get back to the Emerald City observed Pigasus scratching his left ear with his right hind paw Why we could swoop down on this Emperor bind him fast and tweak him by the nose before he even knew what was happening Why so we could beamed Dorothy brightening up at once And now though of course black is a perfectly beautiful color could you change us back to the colors we were when we came Dorothy spoke timidly for she did not want to hurt Glomas feelings As soon as you leave the forest you will resume your natural coloring the witch assured them with a little smile And where may I ask were you planning to go first Well said Dorothy slowly I thought perhaps the countries outside of Oz might not be under this forgetting spell and that we might find in one of them a King who would lend us his army and help us to chase Skamperoo out of the Emerald City Could you transport us as far as Ev your Majesty As easily as I could invite you to dinner Gloma assured them with an energetic little nod and I hope you will not only have dinner but rest yourselves before you start again on your dangerous journey Pigasus C4 Pigasus did you hear that She can transport us all the way to Ev Didnt I tell you we might find a good witch in this forest Now everything will be all right So glad we met and got acquainted Youre not so black as you are painted chuckled Pigasus breaking into rhyme from sheer good humor and relief And did I hear your Majesty invite us to dinner You certainly did said Gloma and dropping them a little bow she swept gaily through the door Dye suppose it will be a black dinner whispered Pigasus trotting briskly along beside Dorothy Ive heard of light repasts but never of dark ones But I dont care Im hungry enough to eat tar pudding with cinder sauce Shhh warned Dorothy with a little laugh Shell hear you CHAPTER 12 FAREWELL TO THE BLACK FOREST Although the dinner in the Black Castle was as dark a repast as Pigasus had predicted never had he or Dorothy dined more royally or partaken of more delicate fare The black bean soup was followed by a black fish course then came the dark meat of some superbly cooked fowl probably cinderroosters as Pigasus remarked in one of his humorous asides The licorice was the most delicious of the vegetables though the black asparagus and potatoes were appetizing too Black bread was served with the black grape salad and plum cake with black frosting with the black ices and blackberryade The members of Glomas household now that their fear of Dorothy had been explained away proved so interesting and merry the time simply flew The black lace frocks of the women and children and the soft leather suits of the black foresters were simple but elegant and the Black Queen herself so lovely just to look at her gave one a curious thrill General Blotz recalled from banishment by Blackjack the Queens pet Jackdaw proved a singer of no mean ability and regaled the company with many famous black ballads and hunting songs Pigasus too contributed to the general fun and gaiety with some of his best
