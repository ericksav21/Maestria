l the way across the room and sat staring morosely at the worn carpet The short uneasy nap he finally got before morning did him no good and cross and jumpy as a cougar he made his way to the dingy dining hall of the palace The King had already breakfasted and looking out of the window Matiah saw a terrified servant leading the Talking Horse around the courtyard Skamperoo following at a safe distance The sight of the stamping white charger made Matiah shudder anew What a waste he reflected bitterly and if the King grew fond of the saucy monster it would make his own task even more difficult for until he succeeded in stealing the necklaces Matiah did not intend to let Skamperoo out of his sight Gulping down the weak coffee and cold eggs a shabby servant grudgingly placed before him he hastened outside Good morning your Majesty he called out heartily And may I have a word with your Royal Highness What kind of a word snickered Chalk rolling his yellow eyes roguishly round at the merchant Give him a word old Rubatub if thats all he wants The right word for him I should way would be GO or NO and then we all could be happy It is about the necklaces confided Matiah ignoring the horse utterly and falling uneasily into step with the King They must be cleaned every day to keep them in good wishing condition But I was just going for a ride objected Skamperoo with a little frown Wont this afternoon do No NOW is the proper time answered Matiah impressively thinking how clever he was to have invented this ruse to get hold of the emeralds If your Majesty will just give them to me Ill polish them up while you are C4 er C4 exercising No no er C4 That is Id better come and help you Skamperoo spoke quickly I can ride this afternoon You think so With an exuberant prance Chalk rose on his hind legs and spun around like a pinwheel Well see you later old Sos And with the terrified stable boy hanging onto his bridle he went galloping off to the stable If you take my advice youll have that creature knocked on the head said Matiah savagely Surely you wont endanger our lives by riding on his back OUR lives exclaimed Skamperoo looking at Matiah in surprise You do not have to ride him in fact hes really my horse he stated jealously So long as your Majesty wears the magic necklaces I must go wherever you go and do whatever you do explained the merchant loftily How C4 How very awkward In spite of himself Skamperoo groaned as he thought how tiresome it would be with Matiah trailing after him from morning to night I should think a magician like yourself could arrange things more sensibly But consider what is at stake Matiah reminded him earnestly Together we can have and do anything we wish Is that not worth a little inconvenience Yes yes I suppose so But if we are to do everything together I think I should know the magic wishing formula as well as you Skamperoo looked defiantly up at his newest advisor That is impossible Striding stiffly along Matiah shook his head The incantation once revealed becomes powerless Only one versed in magic is permitted to use the emeralds Have you thought at all about your next wish he asked anxious to direct the Kings mind into more cheerful channels We should plan and consult about it together you know But wait until we are in your Majestys throne room he added quickly as Skamperoo began to open and shut his mouth like a fish without saying anything While I am cleaning the necklaces we can talk it over yes Matiahs fingers fairly itched for the sparkling jewels but restraining a mad impulse to snatch them from the Kings throat he walked along quietly beside Skamperoo talking so calmly and convincingly that he soon had the Skampavian monarch not only willing but anxious to reveal the wish that had kept him awake most of the night First assuring himself that they were alone and locking the door so they would not be disturbed the King seated himself at a small table Matiah drew up a chair opposite and held out his hand for the necklaces Reluctantly Skamperoo handed them over keeping a jealous eye on the jewels as the merchant began polishing them with a small square of silk he had taken from his pocket As he rubbed the silk over the emeralds Matiah carefully examined each one for some mark or sign that would give him a clue to their magic power Intent as he was upon this task a few lowspoken words of Skamperoo made him sit suddenly erect and regard the King with new respect and attention How in thunderation thought Matiah wonderingly has this fat silly monarch ever managed to hit upon such a magnificent and breathtaking wish and as Skamperoo explained and elaborated upon his plan and schemes for the future the merchants interest grew apace Quicker and cleverer than the King he saw not only the possibilities of this splendid wish but all the difficulties and problems that must be met and disposed of before it could reasonably be granted Leaning forward the emeralds for the moment forgotten he put his mouth clos
