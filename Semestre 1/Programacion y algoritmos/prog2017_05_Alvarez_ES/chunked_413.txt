rs may safely pass through the highest strata On debarking however it would be well to don my patent protective air helmets see chest beneath second seat or to take one for each mile up of my elutherated altitude pills from the recess in the table leg Jellia whose bump of curiosity was larger than most lost no time hunting for the helmets Dragging the chest from beneath the second seat and paying no attention to the marching soldier who stepped over her each time he passed she impatiently lifted the lid The four helmets in the chest were of some pliant glassy material resembling cellophane They belted in at the waist and after holding one up for Nicks inspection Jellia put them back and returned the chest to its place Now which leg of which table pondered the little Maid in Waiting her mind turning to the altitude pills Oh what does it matter grinned the Tin Woodman as Jellia crawled under the navigators table and began tapping its legs one after the other Youll soon be on solid earth and wont need altitude pills Nick had made up his mind to bring the Oztober down to a landing wherever they happened to be But Jellia scarcely heard him for at that moment she had discovered a small hook on one of the front legs of the table Pulling it down she disclosed a tall triangular bottle in the hollow center The pills were triangular too and of every color in the rainbow Take one after each mile read Jellia uncorking the bottle and taking a good sniff The pills smelled as good as they looked and she was about to sample one when the Soldier with Green Whiskers gave a hoarse scream and such a leap that his head hit the ceiling Now whats the matter demanded Nick Chopper turning around stiffly while Jellia hastily corked the bottle shoved it back into the table leg and crawled into the aisle NICK shrieked poor Jellia What is it What are they Oh Ozma Oh Wizard Oh help HELP And well might Jellia scream for swarming round the tail of the Oztober came a perfect horde of iridescent monsters In shape each resembled an octopus but instead of arms they had long horny spikes and spines Pressing close to the plane they ogled at the shivering passengers as if they were fish in some strange aquarium Then evidently angered at what they saw they began hurling and banging themselves against the sides of the Oztober till it sounded like the rattle of machine guns At this juncture I am sorry to report Wantowin Battles after sounding a shrill retreat on the bugle attached to his belt rushed into the dressing room and wrapped himself in the shower curtain Nick Chopper who already loved the Wizards ship as if it were his own shuddered as each spike struck the shining metal Then deciding that flight was the better part of valor he hastily changed course zooming up and up faster and faster and FASTER For perhaps a thousand feet the goggleeyed monsters pursued them but at last the air grew too thin and rare for the spikers and one by one they fell away Their horrid squeals and screeches still came faintly to the three voyagers and Jellia ran quickly to the back window to stare down after them Why I never knew there were wild animals in the air stuttered Jellia blinking her eyes rapidly Now I wouldnt exactly call them wild animals said Nick argumentatively twisting his neck from side to side to be sure he was not rusting Well they certainly werent birds declared Jellia indignantly And how did they fly without wings Come on out Soldier theyre gone Ah so we have won Jauntily the Soldier stepped out of the dressing room and resumed his marching Give me credit for sounding the retreat comrades he observed cheerfully Jellia sniffed and Nick Chopper said nothing What are we going to do now inquired the little Oz Maid going over to stand by the wheel How can we ever fly down with those awful creatures below Well just travel horizontally till we are out of their area Nick told her complacently But for a while anyway well go up After all one has to go up to come down you know And when we do come downFF20C4 Nick gave a satisfied little nod C4FF20it will be in a safe spot and far from those spiky airimals So thats what they are But how did you know Jellia looked admiringly at the Tin Woodman Oh it just came to me admitted Nick with a modest cough Beasts of the air must have names I suppose Make a note of those monsters will you Wantowin Im writing them up in my little green book now mumbled the Soldier who was in fact scribbling away hastily as he tramped up and down Ive made a sketch of one too Good Although I didnt suppose youd looked at them long enough for that said Nick a bit sarcastically He glanced hastily at the page the soldier had before his nose Then deciding they had flown high enough he pointed the Oztober toward the east and after an hours leisurely flying again began a slow and cautious descent I do wonder where well land mused Jellia trying to pierce with her bright eyes the bank of fog that lay beneath Somewhere in the Quadling Country I sh
