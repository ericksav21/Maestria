ryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage The houses of the Munchkins were oddlooking dwellings for each was round with a big dome for a roof All were painted blue for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color Toward evening when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat The people greeted Dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself whose name was Boq Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance When Boq saw her silver shoes he said You must be a great sorceress Why asked the girl Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch Besides you have white in your frock and only witches and sorceresses wear white My dress is blue and white checked said Dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it It is kind of you to wear that said Boq Blue is the color of the Munchkins and white is the witch color So we know you are a friendly witch Dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land When she had tired watching the dancing Boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it The sheets were made of blue cloth and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her She ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee Munchkin baby who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before How far is it to the Emerald City the girl asked I do not know answered Boq gravely for I have never been there It is better for people to keep away from Oz unless they have business with him But it is a long way to the Emerald City and it will take you many days The country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey This worried Dorothy a little but she knew that only the Great Oz could help her get to Kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back She bade her friends goodbye and again started along the road of yellow brick When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down There was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a Scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face An old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some Munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw On the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the Scarecrow she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her She thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while Toto ran around the pole and barked Good day said the Scarecrow in a rather husky voice Did you speak asked the girl in wonder Certainly answered the Scarecrow How do you do Im pretty well thank you replied Dorothy politely How do you do Im not feeling well said the Scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows Cant you get down asked Dorothy No for this pole is stuck up my back If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light Thank you very much said the Scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground I feel like a new man Dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her Who are you asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned And where
