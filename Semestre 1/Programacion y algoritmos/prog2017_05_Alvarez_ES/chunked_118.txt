 but he destroyed it Then how could it be a long life asked Dorothy Easily enough was the reply Now suppose my dear that I gave you a pretty doll in exchange for a lock of your hair and that after you had received the doll you smashed it into pieces and destroyed it Could you say that I had not given you a pretty doll No answered Dorothy And could you in fairness ask me to return to you the lock of hair just because you had smashed the doll No said Dorothy again Of course not the Nome King returned Nor will I give up the Queen and her children because the King of Ev destroyed his long life by jumping into the sea They belong to me and I shall keep them But you are treating them cruelly said Ozma who was much distressed by the Kings refusal In what way he asked By making them your slaves said she Cruelty remarked the monarch puffing out wreathes of smoke and watching them float into the air is a thing I cant abide So as slaves must work hard and the Queen of Ev and her children were delicate and tender I transformed them all into articles of ornament and bricabrac and scattered them around the various rooms of my palace Instead of being obliged to labor they merely decorate my apartments and I really think I have treated them with great kindness But what a dreadful fate is theirs exclaimed Ozma earnestly And the Kingdom of Ev is in great need of its royal family to govern it If you will liberate them and restore them to their proper forms I will give you ten ornaments to replace each one you lose The Nome King looked grave Suppose I refuse he asked Then said Ozma firmly I am here with my friends and my army to conquer your kingdom and oblige you to obey my wishes The Nome King laughed until he choked and he choked until he coughed and he coughed until his face turned from grayishbrown to bright red And then he wiped his eyes with a rockcolored handkerchief and grew grave again You are as brave as you are pretty my dear he said to Ozma But you have little idea of the extent of the task you have undertaken Come with me for a moment He arose and took Ozmas hand leading her to a little door at one side of the room This he opened and they stepped out upon a balcony from whence they obtained a wonderful view of the Underground World A vast cave extended for miles and miles under the mountain and in every direction were furnaces and forges glowing brightly and Nomes hammering upon precious metals or polishing gleaming jewels All around the walls of the cave were thousands of doors of silver and gold built into the solid rock and these extended in rows far away into the distance as far as Ozmas eyes could follow them While the little maid from Oz gazed wonderingly upon this scene the Nome King uttered a shrill whistle and at once all the silver and gold doors flew open and solid ranks of Nome soldiers marched out from every one So great were their numbers that they quickly filled the immense underground cavern and forced the busy workmen to abandon their tasks Although this tremendous army consisted of rockcolored Nomes all squat and fat they were clothed in glittering armor of polished steel inlaid with beautiful gems Upon his brow each wore a brilliant electric light and they bore sharp spears and swords and battleaxes of solid bronze It was evident they were perfectly trained for they stood in straight rows rank after rank with their weapons held erect and true as if awaiting but the word of command to level them upon their foes This said the Nome King is but a small part of my army No ruler upon Earth has ever dared to fight me and no ruler ever will for I am too powerful to oppose He whistled again and at once the martial array filed through the silver and gold doorways and disappeared after which the workmen again resumed their labors at the furnaces Then sad and discouraged Ozma of Oz turned to her friends and the Nome King calmly reseated himself on his rock throne It would be foolish for us to fight the girl said to the Tin Woodman For our brave TwentySeven would be quickly destroyed Im sure I do not know how to act in this emergency Ask the King where his kitchen is suggested the Tiger Im hungry as a bear I might pounce upon the King and tear him in pieces remarked the Cowardly Lion Try it said the monarch lighting his pipe with another hot coal which he took from his pocket The Lion crouched low and tried to spring upon the Nome King but he hopped only a little way into the air and came down again in the same place not being able to approach the throne by even an inch It seems to me said the Scarecrow thoughtfully that our best plan is to wheedle his Majesty into giving up his slaves since he is too great a magician to oppose This is the most sensible thing any of you have suggested declared the Nome King It is folly to threaten me but Im so kindhearted that I cannot stand coaxing or wheedling If you really wish to accomplish anything by your journey my dear Ozma you must coax me Very well said Ozma more
