re is no one to rule the Land of Ev that I can think of Perhaps it is for this reason that the Wheelers claim the trees for their own and pick the luncheons and dinners to eat themselves But they belong to the King and you will find the royal E stamped upon the bottom of every dinner pail Dorothy turned the pail over and at once discovered the royal mark upon it as Tiktok had said Are the Wheelers the only folks living in the Land of Ev enquired the girl No they only inhabit a small portion of it just back of the woods replied the machine But they have always been mischievous and impertinent and my old master King Evoldo used to carry a whip with him when he walked out to keep the creatures in order When I was first made the Wheelers tried to run over me and butt me with their heads but they soon found I was built of too solid a material for them to injure You seem very durable said Dorothy Who made you The firm of Smith Tinker in the town of Evna where the royal palace stands answered Tiktok Did they make many of you asked the child No I am the only automatic mechanical man they ever completed he replied They were very wonderful inventors were my makers and quite artistic in all they did I am sure of that said Dorothy Do they live in the town of Evna now They are both gone replied the machine Mr Smith was an artist as well as an inventor and he painted a picture of a river which was so natural that as he was reaching across it to paint some flowers on the opposite bank he fell into the water and was drowned Oh Im sorry for that exclaimed the little girl Mister Tinker continued Tiktok made a ladder so tall that he could rest the end of it against the moon while he stood on the highest rung and picked the little stars to set in the points of the kings crown But when he got to the moon Mister Tinker found it such a lovely place that he decided to live there so he pulled up the ladder after him and we have never seen him since He must have been a great loss to this country said Dorothy who was by this time eating her custard pie He was acknowledged Tiktok Also he is a great loss to me For if I should get out of order I do not know of any one able to repair me because I am so complicated You have no idea how full of machinery I am I can imagine it said Dorothy readily And now continued the machine I must stop talking and begin thinking again of a way to escape from this rock So he turned half way around in order to think without being disturbed The best thinker I ever knew said Dorothy to the yellow hen was a scarecrow Nonsense snapped Billina It is true declared Dorothy I met him in the Land of Oz and he traveled with me to the city of the great Wizard of Oz so as to get some brains for his head was only stuffed with straw But it seemed to me that he thought just as well before he got his brains as he did afterward Do you expect me to believe all that rubbish about the Land of Oz enquired Billina who seemed a little crossperhaps because bugs were scarce What rubbish asked the child who was now finishing her nuts and raisins Why your impossible stories about animals that can talk and a tin woodman who is alive and a scarecrow who can think They are all there said Dorothy for I have seen them I dont believe it cried the hen with a toss of her head Thats cause youre so ignrant replied the girl who was a little offended at her friend Billinas speech In the Land of Oz remarked Tiktok turning toward them anything is possible For it is a wonderful fairy country There Billina what did I say cried Dorothy And then she turned to the machine and asked in an eager tone Do you know the Land of Oz Tiktok No but I have heard about it said the copper man For it is only separated from this Land of Ev by a broad desert Dorothy clapped her hands together delightedly Im glad of that she exclaimed It makes me quite happy to be so near my old friends The scarecrow I told you of Billina is the King of the Land of Oz Pardon me He is not the king now said Tiktok He was when I left there declared Dorothy I know said Tiktok but there was a revolution in the Land of Oz and the Scarecrow was deposed by a soldier woman named General Jinjur And then Jinjur was deposed by a little girl named Ozma who was the rightful heir to the throne and now rules the land under the title of Ozma of Oz That is news to me said Dorothy thoughtfully But I spose lots of things have happened since I left the Land of Oz I wonder what has become of the Scarecrow and of the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion And I wonder who this girl Ozma is for I never heard of her before But Tiktok did not reply to this He had turned around again to resume his thinking Dorothy packed the rest of the food back into the pail so as not to be wasteful of good things and the yellow hen forgot her dignity far enough to pick up all of the scattered crumbs which she ate rather greedily although she had so lately pretended to despise the things that Dorothy preferred as food By this time
