he Winged Monkeys are now the slaves of Glinda the Good who owns the Golden Cap that commands their services said the Scarecrow reflectively Then the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of past adventures And the SawHorse rocked and rolled over the flowerstrewn fields and carried its riders swiftly upon their way Twilight fell bye and bye and then the dark shadows of night So Tip stopped the horse and they all proceeded to dismount Im tired out said the boy yawning wearily and the grass is soft and cool Let us lie down here and sleep until morning 118 I cant sleep said Jack I never do said the Scarecrow I do not even know what sleep is said the SawHorse Still we must have consideration for this poor boy who is made of flesh and blood and bone and gets tired suggested the Scarecrow in his usual thoughtful manner I remember it was the same way with little Dorothy We always had to sit through the night while she slept Im sorry said Tip meekly but I cant help it And Im dreadfully hungry too Here is a new danger remarked Jack gloomily I hope you are not fond of eating pumpkins Not unless theyre stewed and made into pies answered the boy laughing So have no fears of me friend Jack What a coward that Pumpkinhead is said the SawHorse scornfully You might be a coward yourself if you knew you were liable to spoil retorted Jack angrily Therethere interrupted the Scarecrow dont let us quarrel We all have our weaknesses dear friends so we must strive to be considerate of one another And since this poor boy is hungry and has nothing whatever to eat let us all remain 119 quiet and allow him to sleep for it is said that in sleep a mortal may forget even hunger Thank you exclaimed Tip gratefully Your Majesty is fully as good as you are wiseand that is saying a good deal He then stretched himself upon the grass and using the stuffed form of the Scarecrow for a pillow was presently fast asleep LineArt Drawing 120 Full page lineart drawing 121 A NickelPlated Emperor Tip awoke soon after dawn but the Scarecrow had already risen and plucked with his clumsy fingers a doublehandful of ripe berries from some bushes near by These the boy ate greedily finding them an ample breakfast and afterward the little party resumed its Journey After an hours ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they espied the City of the Winkies and noted the tall domes of the Emperors palace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings The Scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight and exclaimed How delighted I shall be to see my old friend the Tin Woodman again I hope that he rules his people more successfully than I have ruled mine Is the Tin Woodman the Emperor of the Winkies asked the horse Yes indeed They invited him to rule over 122 them soon after the Wicked Witch was destroyed and as Nick Chopper has the best heart in all the world I am sure he has proved an excellent and able emperor I thought that Emperor was the title of a person who rules an empire said Tip and the Country of the Winkies is only a Kingdom Dont mention that to the Tin Woodman exclaimed the Scarecrow earnestly You would hurt his feelings terribly He is a proud man as he has every reason to be and it pleases him to be termed Emperor rather than King Im sure it makes no difference to me replied the boy The SawHorse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had hard work to stick upon its back so there was little further conversation until they drew up beside the palace steps An aged Winkie dressed in a uniform of silver cloth came forward to assist them to alight Said the Scarecrow to his personage Show us at once to your master the Emperor The man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way and finally answered I fear I must ask you to wait for a time The Emperor is not receiving this morning 123 How is that enquired the Scarecrow anxiously I hope nothing has happened to him Oh no nothing serious returned the man But this is his Majestys day for being polished and just now his august presence is thickly smeared with putzpomade Oh I see cried the Scarecrow greatly reassured My friend was ever inclined to be a dandy and I suppose he is now more proud than ever of his personal appearance He is indeed said the man with a polite bow Our mighty Emperor has lately caused himself to be nickelplated Good Gracious the Scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this If his wit bears the same polish how sparkling it must be But show us inIm sure the Emperor will receive us even in his present state The Emperors state is always magnificent said the man But I will venture to tell him of your arrival and will receive his commands concerning you So the party followed the servant into a splendid anteroom and the Saw Horse ambled awkwardly after them having no knowledge that a horse might be expected to remain outside 124 The travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings and even the Scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined
