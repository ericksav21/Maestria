 are you going My name is Dorothy said the girl and I am going to the Emerald City to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas Where is the Emerald City he inquired And who is Oz Why dont you know she returned in surprise No indeed I dont know anything You see I am stuffed so I have no brains at all he answered sadly Oh said Dorothy Im awfully sorry for you Do you think he asked if I go to the Emerald City with you that Oz would give me some brains I cannot tell she returned but you may come with me if you like If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now That is true said the Scarecrow You see he continued confidentially I dont mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because I cannot get hurt If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it doesnt matter for I cant feel it But I do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am I ever to know anything I understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him If you will come with me Ill ask Oz to do all he can for you Thank you he answered gratefully They walked back to the road Dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City Toto did not like this addition to the party at first He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow Dont mind Toto said Dorothy to her new friend He never bites Oh Im not afraid replied the Scarecrow He cant hurt the straw Do let me carry that basket for you I shall not mind it for I cant get tired Ill tell you a secret he continued as he walked along There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of What is that asked Dorothy the Munchkin farmer who made you No answered the Scarecrow its a lighted match 4 The Road Through the Forest After a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven Sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around As for the Scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks It never hurt him however and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became At noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread She offered a piece to the Scarecrow but he refused I am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing I am not for my mouth is only painted and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat the straw I am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head Dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from said the Scarecrow when she had finished her dinner So she told him all about Kansas and how gray everything was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer Land of Oz The Scarecrow listened carefully and said I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call Kansas That is because you have no brains answered the girl No matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful There is no place like home The Scarecrow sighed Of course I cannot understand it he said If your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then Kansas would have no people at all It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains Wont you tell me a story while we are resting asked the child The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully and answered My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever I was only made day before yesterday What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me Luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that I heard what was going on There was another Munchkin with him and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying How do you like those ears They arent straight answered the other Never mind said the farmer They are ears just the same which was true enough Now Ill make the eyes said the farmer So he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world Thats a rather pretty eye remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer Blue paint
