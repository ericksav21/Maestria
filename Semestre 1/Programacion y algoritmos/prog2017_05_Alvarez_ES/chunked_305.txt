the clever cook let down the ships nets daily The seaweed crisp tender and green was dragged on deck where Roger and Tandy went carefully through it removing all crabs small fish and seashells which seriously disagreed with the hippopotamus A huge hamperfull was lowered to her every evening and with this plentiful supply of green food and with the bread and delicious vegetable scraps Ato saved from the table Nikobo fared better than she had on the island The largest tub on the boat served as a drinking cup and this Tandy kept full by playing down the hose from the deck giving her a daily shower of fresh water at the same time So lacking nothing in interest or comfort Nikobo enjoyed herself hugely and to the fullest extent On calm mornings with the Crescent Moon hove to all hands would go swimming Nikobo loved to swim and to roll over and over like a mighty porpoise even though the salt water made her eyes sting Since Tandy had given Samuel the drawings of the Leopard Men the ships Captain could not do enough for his young cabin boy and among other things had made a rope harness for Nikobo so Tandy could hang on when he perched upon her slippery back At first he had been satisfied to ride Nikobo but after several days he was splashing recklessly with the others and Samuel had taught him all the swimming strokes he knew and had Tandy diving over and under the hippopotamus in a way to make Roger scream with envy and approval Swimming was the only part of a sea voyage the Read Bird could not really enjoy but he was always on hand to give advice roosting on Nikobos head so long as she stayed above water and taking hurriedly to his wings when she mischievously tried to duck him The hippopotamus made a really splendid raft when they tired of swimming and Ato who did not care for water sports so much as Samuel or Tandy fished for hours from her back his feet hooked through the ropes of her harness to keep him from falling into the sea The only thing Tandy regretted was Nikobos great size and that she could not come aboard ship and join them in the cabin On cool evenings he and Ato and the Captain Roger preferring to take first watch would sit cozily round the fire listening to the stories Samuel told them of the days when he had been a pirate and roamed up and down the Nonestic capturing the ships and treasure of all the powerful island monarchs Tandy never tired of these thrilling sea battles or of watching Samuel Salts pet fire lizard Sally was now so tame she would allow any one of them to pick her up They had to be careful not to hold her against their clothing however for though Sally did not burn the fingers she set fire to whatever she touched Indeed whenever they wanted a fire in the grate they had only to place the Salamander on the kindling beneath the logs and a cheery flame would blaze up instantly It was in the fireplace that Sally took most of her exercise racing and skittering over the glowing logs or rolling happily in the redhot embers But most of her time she spent curled up in Samuel Salts pipe and it was always a surprise to Tandy to see her comical head pop up over the edge of the bowl or hear her chirping and purring to herself from her cozy bed of tobacco leaves Some evenings when Ato was trying out new recipes in the galley Tandy and Samuel would descend to the hold to look over the plants from Patrippany Island try to figure out the script on the piece of lava and sort and arrange Samuels shell collection Every day after the nets were drawn up there were new specimens to classify and label The drawing Tandy had made of the Sea Lion and all the pictures of the Leopard Men and beasts on Patrippany Island Samuel had framed and hung above his shelves so that the hold was looking more and more like a scientific laboratory every day Do you suppose well ever find anything large enough to put in those big cages and aquariums asked Tandy one night as he pasted a pink label on a fluted conch shell Sures eight bells murmured Samuel Salt comfortably No telling whatll turn up on a voyage like this Personally Ive set my heart on a rocs egg but setting the heart on a rocs egg wont hatch one out Ho Ho No No But on the other hand one never can tell and weve had a week of such fine and pleasant days I look for something to happen any moment now so youd better put up your paste pot and turn in my lad so well all be ready for the morning Well what would you do with a rocs egg inquired Tandy reluctantly clapping the top on his bottle of glue Arent they terribly big and terribly scarce Captain Salt Terribly admitted Samuel Salt placing his tray of lamp shells back on their stand But a newly laid rocs egg is as rare as a mermaids foot and no larger than one tar barrel Now if we could just get a newly laid rocs egg aboard and find some way to preserve it well and good if we didnt find a way and it hatched before we landed it could easily fly off with us and the ship for THATS how big a bird a roc is But Ill take a
