of Oz Sitting up in bed Skamperoo was busily counting the gems in his three magic chains Ho throw those silly beads away advised the white horse jumping out of bed with a gay toss of his golden mane You have nothing else to wish for Kingaling nothing more at all Mmmm this green carpet looks good enough to eat but Ive a fancy to nibble the clover in Your Majestys garden while it is still fresh with dew Say it again begged Skamperoo closing his eyes and clasping himself blissfully around the middle Your Majestys garden Your Majestys Palace Your Majestys Kingdom of Oz whinnied the white horse rising on his hind legs and pirouetting round with mischievous little prances But come Emp What are your wishes for today I think we will have to use the necklaces after all You must certainly have some new clothes It would never do to appear this morning in the suit you wore last night You had better have some sleeping garments too Ive a notion that Emperors do not sleep in their raw hides like horses Skamperoo giggling selfconsciously dragged the satin sheets up to his chin for to tell the truth he had arrived in the Emerald City with only one suit to his back and an extremely shabby one at that Maybe Id better change my face too he murmured to go with all this you know Dreamily Skamperoo waved his hands about and then leaning forward slipped the chains over Chalks ear Whats the matter with the face you have demanded Chalk gazing fondly at the red rotund countenance of his Master I like you just as you are and if you change I wouldnt even know you but Ill tell you what you can wish after youve ordered yourself some new clothes C4 wish yourself a seasoned rider and then we can go far and wide Kingaling far and wide at a furious gallop and none shall say us nay C4 hey hey And none shall say us nay trilled Skamperoo rolling out of bed covers and all To wish himself fifty jewelencrusted robes with boots crowns and all the undergarments to go with them fifty splendid sleeping robes and fifty suits of riding clothes took but a moment He and Chalk could hear them landing with little thuds on the hangars in the many closets as Skamperoo finished speaking Then being naturally lazy the new Emperor wished that he had already had his bath and was dressed in his green riding clothes So immediately he was and winking at his clever assistant adviser he next wished himself the best rider in Oz Then taking back his necklaces he buttoned them carefully in a little pocket over his heart and went over to the mirror to have a look at himself How about this governing stuff puffed the selfmade Emperor turning this way and that to get a good view of his new clothes Oh I shouldnt bother about governing answered Chalk carelessly A wellgoverned country like this should be able to run itself for a few weeks By that time well be ready for more serious matters but right now Im all for enjoying myself A splendid idea that of putting all the rulers and the Wizard and his magic out of the way The rest of your court and subjects are exceedingly sensible and jolly and if we are pleasant and sensible too everything will be What ho and so cozy So lets go below and start our first day of emperoaring Impatiently Chalk pranced away toward the door Youre sure I look all right asked Skamperoo with another anxious squint at his reflection Seems to me Im a bit fat Oh dont worry about that said Chalk rolling his eyes wickedly Come along come along and Ill soon shake some of that fat off you Up with you Kingaling and lets to our oats To his delight and pleasure Skamperoo had not the slightest trouble mounting and once in the saddle he felt perfectly at home even when Chalk bounded through the door took the long circular steps between a canter and a gallop and ran madly three times round the Royal gardens On fine days Ozma always had breakfast in her private garden and it being an especially fine day the palace servants without thought or question had placed the royal table under the trees It was still fairly early and none of the guests or members of the household were down but this did not spoil Skamperoos excellent appetite at all Ordering Chalk a breakfast of oats bran and quartered apples he seated himself gaily at the head of the table The green riding hat set well over one ear became him vastly well and Chalk regarding him proudly from the foot of the table thought him every inch an Emperor even if round the waist there were a good many too many inches I wish Pinny Penny could see you now sighed the horse sinking contentedly back on his haunches and how I should have enjoyed seeing Matiahs face when he finally discovered you and the necklaces were gone By the way perhaps we should do something about Matiah Pinny Penny will attend to him said Skamperoo popping a huge cherry into his mouth and nodding his head reassuringly Ill wager Pinny Penny sent the fellow packing the moment he found himself King Wonder how Pinny is making out anyway But suppose Matiah shou
