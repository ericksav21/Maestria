ut his horns Watch this my friends The Goat Girl gave the horn she was leaning on a sharp twist Not that one Not that one fumed the Ox anxiously Quick the other Its the other one I tell you Oh my hide hair and Heavens Ulp Gurgle Ooooop And Oooop gurgle ULP it was with everyone for at Handy Mandys second turn Noxs horn came completely off and as the Goat Girl held it up for the Topsies to see out spurted a perfect torrent of water that flooded the whole city till every Turner and Topsyturvy house in it was awash or afloat In wild and astonished voices the kinkyheaded little citizens called out to each other as they bobbed up and down like corks on the raging tide And just as wet and surprised as the Topsies the Goat Girl and Nox were swept along by the impetuous flood CHAPTER 7 A HORN OF PLENTY After the first awful ducking Handy without losing a second began to practice her swimming Striking out with strength and purpose and her seven good arms she managed to keep abreast of Nox who was moving easily along in the center of the torrent Bothersome as the Topsies had been the Goat Girl could not help feeling sorry for the little Turn Towners At first she feared they would all go down But they just spun like water bugs on the surface and while they made no progress they seemed in little danger of drowning In fact they could no more sink than corks or kindling So busy with her own struggles Handy dismissed them from her mind and tried to figure out the reason for the sudden and overwhelming rush of water that had deluged the city At any rate it was fine to be rid of the Topsies she reflected philosophically and when the flood did recede Turn Town would be good as new and twice as clean The current was racing along so swiftly now that the last Topsy had long since disappeared leaving only herself and Nox in the broad tumbling expanse of water Nox had not uttered a word since his first outcry when the flood had overtaken them but he looked so glum and disagreeable that Handy thrashing along beside him wondered what would be the best way to start a conversation As it happened the Royal beast saved her the trouble by starting one himself Well he snorted bitterly I see you still have it WHAT gulped the Goat Girl forgetting to use her arms for a moment and in consequence shipping about a bucket of water Ulp C4 gulp C4 have what My horn HORN gurgled Nox glaring at her angrily over a wave And if in the future you will keep your hands all of them off my horns it will be the better for us This seemed to Handy a very unjust and unreasonable attitude for Nox to take but she was too occupied keeping afloat to stop and argue the matter Swim closer and Ill screw it back she offered obligingly holding up the wooden hand in which she still clutched the right half of the royal headgear But at this poor Nox was deluged by a robust stream that still poured from the golden horn Hastily plunging it under the surface again Handy watched her fellow adventurer emerge sputtering and furious from the depths Well of all the stupid tricks gasped the Ox swimming rapidly away from her Stop Keep off Dont you dare come near me But see here panted Handy going after him in real exasperation after all it is your horn and am I to blame if there is a river inside What do you want me to do throw it away No No bellowed the Ox stopping short and looking frantically over his shoulder If you throw it away Ill look like a fool If you keep holding it well spend the rest of our lives swimming round in this torrent If you screw it back on my head it will probably give me water on the brain Oh blub glub What shall we do THINK of something cant you before we both drown in your stupid old river My river Handy Mandy was so indignant that for a moment she was perfectly speechless Yes your river roared Nox treading water angrily Didnt you wish for a river just before you jerked off my horn Well this is it and I hope you like it Why Nox how clever of you to guess bubbled the Goat Girl a great light breaking over her wet head I remember now I was thirsty and wished for a drink then a whole river And lo a river was here You mean HIGH it was here raged Nox beginning to swim again But look cried Handy beating and slapping the water exultantly with her many hands If that is so all we have to do is to wish it away again Im still holding the magic horn and theres magic in it old Toddywax C4 MAGIC I here and now wish this river AWAY Handy yelled her wish in a booming voice that almost split the Oxs eardrums and both were so sure the wish would be granted they stopped swimming so both had a fine ducking as the river continued to rush merrily and unconcernedly over their heads Bosh It wasnt magic after all MyC4y if I ever get out of here Ill never go swimming again as long as I live sobbed Handy pushing her arms and legs wearily through the water Oh I think Ill just sink and be done with it moaned the Ox churning breathlessly along beside her You think youll sink exclaimed H
