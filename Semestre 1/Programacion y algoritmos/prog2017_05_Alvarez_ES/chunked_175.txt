y played the National air called The Oz Spangled Banner and behind them were the standard bearers with the Royal flag This flag was divided into four quarters one being colored skyblue another pink a third lavender and a fourth white In the center was a large emeraldgreen star and all over the four quarters were sewn spangles that glittered beautifully in the sunshine The colors represented the four countries of Oz and the green star the Emerald City Just behind the royal standardbearers came the Princess Ozma in her royal chariot which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamonds set in exquisite designs The chariot was drawn on this occasion by the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger who were decorated with immense pink and blue bows In the chariot rode Ozma and Dorothy the former in splendid raiment and wearing her royal coronet while the little Kansas girl wore around her waist the Magic Belt she had once captured from the Nome King Following the chariot came the Scarecrow mounted on the Sawhorse and the people cheered him almost as loudly as they did their lovely Ruler Behind him stalked with regular jerky steps the famous machineman called Tiktok who had been wound up by Dorothy for the occasion Tiktok moved by clockwork and was made all of burnished copper He really belonged to the Kansas girl who had much respect for his thoughts after they had been properly wound and set going but as the copper man would be useless in any place but a fairy country Dorothy had left him in charge of Ozma who saw that he was suitably cared for There followed another band after this which was called the Royal Court Band because the members all lived in the palace They wore white uniforms with real diamond buttons and played What is Oz without Ozma very sweetly Then came Professor WoggleBug with a group of students from the Royal College of Scientific Athletics The boys wore long hair and striped sweaters and yelled their college yell every other step they took to the great satisfaction of the populace which was glad to have this evidence that their lungs were in good condition The brilliantly polished Tin Woodman marched next at the head of the Royal Army of Oz which consisted of twentyeight officers from Generals down to Captains There were no privates in the army because all were so courageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one until there were no privates left Jim and the buggy followed the old cabhorse being driven by Zeb while the Wizard stood up on the seat and bowed his bald head right and left in answer to the cheers of the people who crowded thick about him Taken altogether the procession was a grand success and when it had returned to the palace the citizens crowded into the great Throne Room to see the Wizard perform his tricks The first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white piglet from underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart making two This act he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible and they were so glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in a very lively manner The pretty little creatures would have been a novelty anywhere so the people were as amazed and delighted at their appearance as even the Wizard could have desired When he had made them all disappear again Ozma declared she was sorry they were gone for she wanted one of them to pet and play with So the Wizard pretended to take one of the piglets out of the hair of the Princess while really he slyly took it from his inside pocket and Ozma smiled joyously as the creature nestled in her arms and she promised to have an emerald collar made for its fat neck and to keep the little squealer always at hand to amuse her Afterward it was noticed that the Wizard always performed his famous trick with eight piglets but it seemed to please the people just as well as if there had been nine of them In his little room back of the Throne Room the Wizard had found a lot of things he had left behind him when he went away in the balloon for no one had occupied the apartment in his absence There was enough material there to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learned from some of the jugglers in the circus and he had passed part of the night in getting them ready So he followed the trick of the nine tiny piglets with several other wonderful feats that greatly delighted his audience and the people did not seem to care a bit whether the little man was a humbug Wizard or not so long as he succeeded in amusing them They applauded all his tricks and at the end of the performance begged him earnestly not to go away again and leave them In that case said the little man gravely I will cancel all of my engagements before the crowned heads of Europe and America and devote myself to the people of Oz for I love you all so well that I can deny you nothing After the people had been dismissed with this promise our friends joined Princess Ozma at an elaborate luncheon in the palace where eve
