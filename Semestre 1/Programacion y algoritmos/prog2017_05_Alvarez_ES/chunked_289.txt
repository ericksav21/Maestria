and As Roger talked on making numerous suggestions the Captain of the Crescent Moon drew with red chalk a small but effective picture of Salamander Island showing the volcano in action and the Lavaland Islanders grouped around the craters top Taken this day without a shot or the loss of a single man printed Samuel in neat letters under his sketch Dont forget you shot the baby twittered Roger raising a claw argumentatively Oh we cant put in small details like that sniffed the Captain stepping back to admire his drawing Seems odd for us to be discovering and taking possession of islands for a country we know so little about mused Ato looking thoughtfully at the map on the west wall Why weve only been to Oz once ourselves Yes but everybody knows about Oz Samuel said putting the red chalk back in the table drawer Our business is with wild new countries that have never been seen or heard of Besides anyone can see that Oz is overpopulated and needs new territories and seaports And since Ozma is so clever at governing and her subjects all so happy and prosperous the more people who come under her rule the better Aye Aye agreed Roger peering with deep interest at the map Small wonder the Read Bird was interested for Oz is one of the most exciting and enchanting countries ever discovered There are four large Kingdoms in Ozmas realm the Northern Land of the Gillikens the Eastern Empire of the Winkies the Southern Country of the Quadlings and the Western domain of the Munchkins Each forms a triangle in the oblong of Oz The Emerald City which is the capital is in the exact center where all these triangles meet Each of these Kingdoms has its own ruler but all four are under the sovereign rule and control of Ozma the small but powerful fairy who lives in the Emerald City On all sides Oz is surrounded by a deadly desert and beyond the desert lie the independent Kingdoms of NoLand Low Land Ix Play Ev the Dominions of the Gnome King and many other strange and important Principalities These countries form a narrow rim around the desert and beyond this rim lies the Nonestic Ocean itself stretching in all directions and to no one knows what far and undiscovered shores20 Each of the four Kingdoms in Oz shown on Samuels map was so dotted with smaller Kingdoms cities towns villages and the holdings of ancient Knights and Barons there was scarcely room for another castle With young Princes growing up on every hand Roger could well sympathize with the need of Ozma for more territory Wont the Ozians have too long a way to come before they reach these new islands and countries we discover inquired the Read Bird after staring at the map for some moments in silence Not a bit of it Samuel dismissed Rogers objection with a snap of his fingers I hear the Wizard of Oz is working on a new fleet of airships that will make crossing the desert and Nonestic a real lark and enable new settlers to reach these outlying islands in a day or less So all we have to do is to proceed with our discovering Ozma will attend to the rest This volcanic island may not be as useful as some of the others but one can never tell How about picking up a few islands for you Ato as we ride along The former pirate dropped his arm affectionately round the shoulders of his Royal Cook No thanks grunted Ato rolling cheerfully to his feet Ones enough What would I want with any more islands Why Id never get off on a voyage But pick yourself a couple Sammy why dont you Who ME Samuel Salt shook his head emphatically A ships all I can handle and I wouldnt trade you two buckets of sea water for all the islands in the Nonestic One ship and one crews enough for me and since youre my crew youd better turn inFF20C4 weve had a hard day and another one coming Ill take first watch Cooky here shall have middle and you Roger can be the early bird on morning watch Ho hum Im right sleepy at that admitted Ato starting to heap up plates Give me a lift with the dishes Roger will you Oh throw em overboard directed Samuel Salt recklessly Theres plenty more in the hold and Im agin all extry labor Hurray screamed Roger seizing the coffee pot and winging merrily through an open port Avast Avast there Not my coffee pot pleaded Ato making after the Read Bird with surprising speed considering his tonnage Stop you great Gossoon How many times must I tell you Im boss of the galley Catching Roger by the leg just as he reached the rail Ato snatched back his precious coffee pot and hugged it protectively to his bosom Why Ive just got this contraption broken in proper he panted indignantly A coffee pots like a pipe its got to be sweetened and seasoned Heave over the plates and cups if you like he went on relenting a bit as he noted the keen disappointment on Rogers face but save the soup tureen Ill wager theres not another that size on the ship and the Captain must have his soup What a splendid pot of soup THIS would make murmured Ato looking dreamily down at the sea A bit salty perhaps but full of snapper
