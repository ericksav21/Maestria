d down before me I told them I was a Wizard and showed them some easy tricks that amazed them and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they called me Oz Now I begin to understand said the Princess smiling At that time continued the Wizard busily eating his soup while talking there were four separate countries in this Land each one of the four being ruled by a Witch But the people thought my power was greater than that of the Witches and perhaps the Witches thought so too for they never dared oppose me I ordered the Emerald City to be built just where the four countries cornered together and when it was completed I announced myself the Ruler of the Land of Oz which included all the four countries of the Munchkins the Gillikins the Winkies and the Quadlings Over this Land I ruled in peace for many years until I grew old and longed to see my native city once again So when Dorothy was first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged to go away with her in a balloon but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me back alone After many adventures I reached Omaha only to find that all my old friends were dead or had moved away So having nothing else to do I joined a circus again and made my balloon ascensions until the earthquake caught me That is quite a history said Ozma but there is a little more history about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to understandperhaps for the reason that no one ever told it you Many years before you came here this Land was united under one Ruler as it is now and the Rulers name was always Oz which means in our language Great and Good or if the Ruler happened to be a woman her name was always Ozma But once upon a time four Witches leagued together to depose the king and rule the four parts of the kingdom themselves so when the Ruler my grandfather was hunting one day one Wicked Witch named Mombi stole him and carried him away keeping him a close prisoner Then the Witches divided up the kingdom and ruled the four parts of it until you came here That was why the people were so glad to see you and why they thought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler But at that time said the Wizard thoughtfully there were two Good Witches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land Yes replied Ozma because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in the North and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South But Mombi was still my grandfathers jailor and afterward my fathers jailor When I was born she transformed me into a boy hoping that no one would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess of the Land of Oz But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of my people I am very glad of that said the Wizard and hope you will consider me one of your most faithful and devoted subjects We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard continued the Princess for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City Your people built it he answered I only bossed the job as we say in Omaha But you ruled it wisely and well for many years said she and made the people proud of your magical art So as you are now too old to wander abroad and work in a circus I offer you a home here as long as you live You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom and be treated with every respect and consideration I accept your kind offer with gratitude gracious Princess the little man said in a soft voice and they could all see that teardrops were standing in his keen old eyes It meant a good deal to him to secure a home like this Hes only a humbug Wizard though said Dorothy smiling at him And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have replied Ozma promptly Oz can do some good tricks humbug or no humbug announced Zeb who was now feeling more at ease He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow said the Princess I have sent messengers to summon all of Dorothys old friends to meet her and give her welcome and they ought to arrive very soon now Indeed the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow to hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see her again The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man who was an important personage in the Land of Oz How are your brains enquired the little humbug as he grasped the soft stuffed hands of his old friend Working finely answered the Scarecrow Im very certain Oz that you gave me the best brains in the world for I can think with them day and night when all other brains are fast asleep How long did you rule the Emerald City after I left here was the next question Quite awhile until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur But Ozma soon conquered her with the help of Glinda the Good and after that I went to live with Nick Chopper the Tin Woodman Just then a loud cackling was heard outside and when a servant threw open the door with a low bow a yellow hen strutted in Dorothy sprang forward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms uttering at the same time a glad cry Oh Billina she said how fat and sle
