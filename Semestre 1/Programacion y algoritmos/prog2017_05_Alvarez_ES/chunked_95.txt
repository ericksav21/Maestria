at Uncle Henry was missing She couldnt imagine where he had gone and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him and to fear he might have been careless enough to go on deck In that case he would be in great danger unless he instantly came down again The fact was that Uncle Henry had gone to lie down in his little sleepingberth but Dorothy did not know that She only remembered that Aunt Em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle so at once she decided to go on deck and find him in spite of the fact that the tempest was now worse than ever and the ship was plunging in a really dreadful manner Indeed the little girl found it was as much as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck and as soon as she got there the wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the skirts of her dress Yet Dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the storm and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through the gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast not far away from her This might be her uncle so she called as loudly as she could Uncle Henry Uncle Henry But the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her own voice and the man certainly failed to hear her for he did not move Dorothy decided she must go to him so she made a dash forward during a lull in the storm to where a big square chickencoop had been lashed to the deck with ropes She reached this place in safety but no sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the chickens were kept than the wind as if enraged because the little girl dared to resist its power suddenly redoubled its fury With a scream like that of an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted it high into the air with Dorothy still clinging to the slats Around and over it whirled this way and that and a few moments later the chickencoop dropped far away into the sea where the big waves caught it and slid it uphill to a foaming crest and then downhill into a deep valley as if it were nothing more than a plaything to keep them amused Dorothy had a good ducking you may be sure but she didnt lose her presence of mind even for a second She kept tight hold of the stout slats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes she saw that the wind had ripped the cover from the coop and the poor chickens were fluttering away in every direction being blown by the wind until they looked like feather dusters without handles The bottom of the coop was made of thick boards so Dorothy found she was clinging to a sort of raft with sides of slats which readily bore up her weight After coughing the water out of her throat and getting her breath again she managed to climb over the slats and stand upon the firm wooden bottom of the coop which supported her easily enough Why Ive got a ship of my own she thought more amused than frightened at her sudden change of condition and then as the coop climbed up to the top of a big wave she looked eagerly around for the ship from which she had been blown It was far far away by this time Perhaps no one on board had yet missed her or knew of her strange adventure Down into a valley between the waves the coop swept her and when she climbed another crest the ship looked like a toy boat it was such a long way off Soon it had entirely disappeared in the gloom and then Dorothy gave a sigh of regret at parting with Uncle Henry and began to wonder what was going to happen to her next Just now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean with nothing to keep her afloat but a miserable wooden hencoop that had a plank bottom and slatted sides through which the water constantly splashed and wetted her through to the skin And there was nothing to eat when she became hungryas she was sure to do before longand no fresh water to drink and no dry clothes to put on Well I declare she exclaimed with a laugh Youre in a pretty fix Dorothy Gale I can tell you and I havent the least idea how youre going to get out of it As if to add to her troubles the night was now creeping on and the gray clouds overhead changed to inky blackness But the wind as if satisfied at last with its mischievous pranks stopped blowing this ocean and hurried away to another part of the world to blow something else so that the waves not being joggled any more began to quiet down and behave themselves It was lucky for Dorothy I think that the storm subsided otherwise brave though she was I fear she might have perished Many children in her place would have wept and given way to despair but because Dorothy had encountered so many adventures and come safely through them it did not occur to her at this time to be especially afraid She was wet and uncomfortable it is true but after sighing that one sigh I told you of she managed to recall some of her customary cheerfulness and decided to patiently await whatever her fate might be By and by the black clouds rolled away and showed a blue sky overh
