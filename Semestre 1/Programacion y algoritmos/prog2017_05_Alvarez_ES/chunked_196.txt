 seriously but Ive noticed if I happen to get lost Im almost sure to come to the Land of Oz in the end somehow r other so I may get there this time But I cant promise you know all I can do is wait and see Will the Scarecrow scare me asked ButtonBright No cause youre not a crow she returned He has the loveliest smile you ever sawonly its painted on and he cant help it Luncheon being over they started again upon their journey the shaggy man Dorothy and ButtonBright walking soberly along side by side and the Rainbows Daughter dancing merrily before them Sometimes she darted along the road so swiftly that she was nearly out of sight then she came tripping back to greet them with her silvery laughter But once she came back more sedately to say Theres a city a little way off I spected that returned Dorothy for the foxpeople warned us there was one on this road Its filled with stupid beasts of some sort but we musnt be afraid of em cause they wont hurt us All right said ButtonBright but Polychrome didnt know whether it was all right or not Its a big city she said and the road runs straight through it Never mind said the shaggy man as long as I carry the Love Magnet every living thing will love me and you may be sure I shant allow any of my friends to be harmed in any way This comforted them somewhat and they moved on again Pretty soon they came to a signpost that read HAF A MYLE TO DUNKITON Oh said the shaggy man if theyre donkeys weve nothing to fear at all They may kick said Dorothy doubtfully Then we will cut some switches and make them behave he replied At the first tree he cut himself a long slender switch from one of the branches and shorter switches for the others Dont be afraid to order the beasts around he said theyre used to it Before long the road brought them to the gates of the city There was a high wall all around which had been whitewashed and the gate just before our travelers was a mere opening in the wall with no bars across it No towers or steeples or domes showed above the enclosure nor was any living thing to be seen as our friends drew near Suddenly as they were about to boldly enter through the opening there arose a harsh clamor of sound that swelled and echoed on every side until they were nearly deafened by the racket and had to put their fingers to their ears to keep the noise out It was like the firing of many cannon only there were no cannonballs or other missiles to be seen it was like the rolling of mighty thunder only not a cloud was in the sky it was like the roar of countless breakers on a rugged seashore only there was no sea or other water anywhere about They hesitated to advance but as the noise did no harm they entered through the whitewashed wall and quickly discovered the cause of the turmoil Inside were suspended many sheets of tin or thin iron and against these metal sheets a row of donkeys were pounding their heels with vicious kicks The shaggy man ran up to the nearest donkey and gave the beast a sharp blow with his switch Stop that noise he shouted and the donkey stopped kicking the metal sheet and turned its head to look with surprise at the shaggy man He switched the next donkey and made him stop and then the next so that gradually the rattling of heels ceased and the awful noise subsided The donkeys stood in a group and eyed the strangers with fear and trembling What do you mean by making such a racket asked the shaggy man sternly We were scaring away the foxes said one of the donkeys meekly Usually they run fast enough when they hear the noise which makes them afraid There are no foxes here said the shaggy man I beg to differ with you Theres one anyhow replied the donkey sitting upright on its haunches and waving a hoof toward ButtonBright We saw him coming and thought the whole army of foxes was marching to attack us ButtonBright isnt a fox explained the shaggy man Hes only wearing a fox head for a time until he can get his own head back Oh I see remarked the donkey waving its left ear reflectively Im sorry we made such a mistake and had all our work and worry for nothing The other donkeys by this time were sitting up and examining the strangers with big glassy eyes They made a queer picture indeed for they wore wide white collars around their necks and the collars had many scallops and points The gentlemendonkeys wore high pointed caps set between their great ears and the ladydonkeys wore sunbonnets with holes cut in the top for the ears to stick through But they had no other clothing except their hairy skins although many wore gold and silver bangles on their front wrists and bands of different metals on their rear ankles When they were kicking they had braced themselves with their front legs but now they all stood or sat upright on their hind legs and used the front ones as arms Having no fingers or hands the beasts were rather clumsy as you may guess but Dorothy was surprised to observe how many things they could do with their stiff heavy hoofs Some of the donke
