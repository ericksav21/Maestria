he Castle of Glinda asked the child It is not a great way answered the farmers wife Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it Thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle Before the gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as Dorothy approached one of them said to her Why have you come to the South Country To see the Good Witch who rules here she answered Will you take me to her Let me have your name and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you They told who they were and the girl soldier went into the Castle After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once 23 Glinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothys Wish Before they went to see Glinda however they were taken to a room of the Castle where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the Lion shook the dust out of his mane and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies She was both beautiful and young to their eyes Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl What can I do for you my child she asked Dorothy told the Witch all her story how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had met with My greatest wish now she added is to get back to Kansas for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned face of the loving little girl Bless your dear heart she said I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas Then she added But if I do you must give me the Golden Cap Willingly exclaimed Dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times And I think I shall need their service just those three times answered Glinda smiling Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap and the Witch said to the Scarecrow What will you do when Dorothy has left us I will return to the Emerald City he replied for Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the HammerHeads By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City said Glinda for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler Am I really wonderful asked the Scarecrow You are unusual replied Glinda Turning to the Tin Woodman she asked What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country He leaned on his axe and thought a moment Then he said The Winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died I am fond of the Winkies and if I could get back again to the Country of the West I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever My second command to the Winged Monkeys said Glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies Your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow but you are really brighter than he iswhen you are well polishedand I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well Then the Witch looked at the big shaggy Lion and asked When Dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you Over the hill of the HammerHeads he answered lies a grand old forest and all the beasts that live there have made me their King If I could only get back to this forest I would pass my life very happily there My third command to the Winged Monkeys said Glinda shall be to carry you to your forest Then having used up the powers of the Golden Cap I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness and Dorothy exclaimed You are certainly as good as you are beautiful But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert replied Glinda If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country But then I should not have had my wonderful brains cried the Scarecrow I might have passed my whole life in the farmers cornfield And I should not have had my lovely heart said the Tin Woodman I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world And I should have lived a coward forever declared the Lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me This is all true said D
