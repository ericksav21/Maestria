rom the Emerald City Why cant those girls stay home Always poking their noses into other peoples affairs and trying to save somebody from something Which one is it asked Shoofenwaller blinking Its Dorothy sighed Kalico taking off his expectacles and putting them absently into his pocket and theres a queer kind of winged pig with her A pig with wings mind you Rooks and rockets Wonder what they want Why not find out suggested Shoofenwaller reasonably No No not tonight Kalico waved his hands determinedly Just conduct them to the red guest cave Shoofenwaller and bring them to me in the morning With a stiff bow the Royal Chamberlain backed out the door and pattered away to admit the visitors And about time too thought Dorothy as the rock door opened cautiously and the little crooked Gnome thrust out his head In the name of King Kalico the First I hereby welcome you to Gnome Mans Land began Shoofenwaller pompously Oh thats all right yawned Pigasus wearily what we want is a place to sleep and remember C4 no trickery he added sharply as the Gnome stood aside so that they could enter the narrow rock passageway I suppose your Highness comes on a matter of state remarked Shoofenwaller turning from Pigasus with an involuntary grimace Pigs reminded him of ham ham reminded him of eggs and eggs were immediate death and destruction to gnomes Well yes admitted Dorothy adjusting her step to the short crooked legs of the Kings little Counselor What I really need is an army An army groaned Shoofenwaller realizing what bad news this would be for his master Our army Oh lets talk about all that in the morning wheezed Pigasus as Dorothy briskly nodded her head in answer to Shoofenwallers question The pink pig was taking sleepy sidelong squints at the elegantly excavated and gemencrusted corridors of the Gnome Kings underground dwelling Just what his Majesty suggested muttered the Chamberlain sweeping open a red iron door with a ruby knob I trust you will be comfortable here and rest well If your Highness wishes a cup of Kalicocoa or your friend a mud pie or pudding just ring the bell Goodnight Princess Goodnight er er C4 PIG Sahay I resent that Pigasus cocked his ears belligerently as the Kings crooked little messenger bowed himself out the door Did you notice the way he said pig Dorothy Yes said Dorothy with a little yawn I did but then all gnomes are sassy and youll have to get used to them If Kalico helps us thats all we care about Pigasus nodded rather grimly I suppose this is what you call getting down to bed rock he murmured looking around the redrock apartment with his amused blue stare Hope the beds arent rock too Punching a red sofa experimentally and finding it surprisingly soft the pink pig jumped up and settled himself cozily among the cushions Pigasus had lived in castles and palaces all his life and was so accustomed to comfort and luxury that without bothering to look around Kalicos richly appointed guest cavern he closed his eyes and fell asleep Dorothy tiptoeing through a curtain into an adjoining redrock cavern that served as a bedroom undressed quickly and putting out the ruby lamps slid thankfully between the red silk sheets and was soon as soundly asleep as Pigasus They were just having breakfast served by two small gnomen in their red sittingcave when Shoofenwaller came hurrying in to announce that Kalico was ready and waiting to see them Earlier the Gnome King and his Chamberlain had discussed the possible purposes of Dorothys visit and Kalico had been extremely annoyed to learn that she wanted to borrow his army And you will lend it to her all our hundred thousand trained Gnomen Yoemen questioned Shoofenwaller anxiously What else can I do Kalico snapped his little gray eyes unhappily Remember it was Dorothy who stole the former Gnome Kings magic belt and really was the means of my becoming King Thats so muttered Shoofenwaller pulling his ear reflectively But why not use a little strategy in this conference King Why not pretend to help her and at the same time safeguard your own interests Lending our army is a dangerous experiment Suppose an enemy threatened us while our fighting forces were in the Emerald City Anything could happen Put her off make excuses urged Shoofenwaller craftily This suggestion fell in exactly with the Gnome Kings wishes and curious to know what really had brought Dorothy to his castle he sent his little Chamberlain hurrying off to bring her to the throne room And now for a little Kalicoaxing sniffed Pigasus waddling unconcernedly along beside Dorothy under magnificent arches over artificial terraces and rock gardens gazing down long vistas of yetunmined shafts where hundreds of gnomes worked busily with picks and shovels to further enrich the already enormously rich and powerful little Metal Monarch Kalico as they entered the beautifully furnished and lavishly carved cave that he used for a throne room came hurrying to meet them So charming of you to come all this way just to see me
