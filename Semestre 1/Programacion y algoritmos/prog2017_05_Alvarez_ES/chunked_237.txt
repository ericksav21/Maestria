and why the King had got his wish and his own wish had gone for nothing What was the secret of the magic emeralds With his forehead still wrinkled in thought Matiah entered the throne room and quietly seated himself in a chair opposite Skamperoo Much to his relief the King neither reproached nor upbraided him As so there you are he cried in his best meanttobecheerful voice I have just sent Pinny Penny to feed your horse My horse barked Matiah starting up in dismay Then catching a meaning wink from the King he quickly winked back It seemed wisest murmured Skamperoo to say nothing of your magic powers for the present All this will be OUR secret he finished playfully Oh yes yes indubitably While Skamperoo was still wondering what indubitably meant Matiah hurried out of the room and took a long drink of water from the oldfashioned fountain in the hall OUR secret he repeated bitterly to himself Our secret indeed CHAPTER 3 MORE ABOUT THE EMERALDS Skamperoo had not slept a wink He tossed from side to side of the royal bed his head simply buzzing with enchanting plans for the future With the magic emeralds he could have everything he desired and his desires and wishes were multiplying so rapidly he scarcely knew where to begin or what to wish for first The necklaces pressed uncomfortably against his throat but he would not take them off He was so weary he ached in every bone but still he could not stop thinking and just as the castle clock tolled seven the very thing he should wish for first came suddenly to him Ah that was it Too bad he had to wait a whole week but a week would pass and perhaps during that time he would discover for himself the magic secret of his sparkling new treasures Then he could be his own magician and put that meddlesome merchant in his place As he was running over in his mind possible places to send Matiah the door of his room opened cautiously and Pinny Penny stuck in his head Well Well And did I ring grunted Skamperoo fretfully This is a fine time to awaken an Emperor Emperor exclaimed Pinny Penny coming all the way into the room and closing the door Since when has Skampavias King become an Emperor Oh go away and dont bother me Turning his back on Pinny Penny the King thumped his pillow and closed his eyes as tightly as he could Its all about the horse whispered Pinny Penny coming around to the other side of the bed A strange and magnificent animal for a mere merchant if I may be permitted to say so Not only that it TALKS Its ordering the stable boys around in a shocking manner and it even told ME to mind my own business Well why dont you suggested Skamperoo rolling over on his back Of course he talks Pinny hes an Oz horse and all animals from Oz talk I thought you knew that Well if this merchant has a talking horse he is not so poor as he pretends persisted Pinny Penny shaking his finger under the Kings nose My advice is to set the fellow on his horse and send him about his business as quickly as possible I dont like his looks Skamper Hes mean and mischievous and mark my words no good will come of him or his necklaces I dont like his looks any better than you agreed the King clasping his fat hands on his stomach But if I keep the emeralds I must keep the merchant and besides Ive a notion I could ride that talking horse myself Oh good goats and gravy Then Id best go and lay in a supply of splints and liniment Pushing his specs up on his forehead Pinny Penny cast a disgusted glance at his huge reclining master and rushed hurriedly from the royal presence Now Matiah as you can well imagine had slept no better than the King In the small room to which Pinny Penny had taken him he paced restlessly up and down After all he knew only two facts about the magic emeralds the first that they really could under certain conditions grant wishes the second that they must not be worn by the person making the wish This much the merchant had reasoned out for himself As the King had got his wish while he Matiah was wearing the necklaces and he himself had not got the wish he made with the emeralds around his own throat that much seemed certain Snapping his fingers joyfully and feeling sure the King was now wearing the jeweled chains Matiah made a second wish counting slowly to a hundred But the hearty supper he had ordered as a test failed to appear and flinging himself down on the bed he began to rack his brains for some other solution to the mystery Perhaps the magic power rested in a single stone which he had luckily touched as the King made his wish Holding his head with both hands he tried to remember exactly what he had done as Skamperoo began to count But it was no use He could not recall a single thing after he had started to run across the garden And how concluded the infuriated fellow was he ever to discover the way to use the emeralds without arousing the Kings suspicions or revealing the fact that he knew no more about them than Skamperoo himself Muttering with vexation he kicked a footstool al
