rd flung up both arms and not knowing whether to dash into the teeth of the monster in front of him or risk the lowered horns of the huge beast behind him the startled magician uttered the word that rendered him invisible Brrrah raged the burly bearlike creature rearing up on his hind legs Where is that pesky mancreature I saw him a moment ago but now though I still catch his scent he has hidden from me And why must you Shagomar come horning in to spoil my supper Why cannot you mind your own business Brrrah I am minding my own business roared the creature addressed as Shagomar AWAY you Entomophagus monster Havent I told you time and again to keep away from the cave of the Princess The very next bugbear that comes prowling round shall have a taste of my antlers Get on with you now and after this leave harmless travelers alone The great red stag made a short rush at the ugly beast blocking his path Large as a Grizzly half insect and half bear it held its ground uncertainly for a moment then shuffled off into the darkness grunting angrily The Wizard who had jumped hastily from between the two beasts had listened to the stags words with lively interest and astonishment Huge and sandy with antlers of tremendous breadth the huge creature now stood quiet as a statue From one antler prong hung a flashing silver lantern From another dangled the bell which had so startled the Wizard Well friend Are you still there whispered the Stag softly Instead of answering the Wizard uttered the word that would make him visible Come with me directed the Stag showing neither surprise nor curiosity at the Wizards sudden reappearance You will be safer with us in the cave Surely you are a stranger or you would know it is dangerous to wander in this forest at night Oh I dont mind danger said the Wizard striding sturdily beside the Stag I am used to danger and I must reach the Emerald City before morning Ozma and her whole capitol are threatened by a band of ruthless Airlanders and unless I can give them some warning the Emerald City certainly will be captured by Strut of the Strat I am Ozmas Chief Magician fallen by great misfortune into this forest I thought you might be a Wizard murmured Shagomar pausing to nibble at a few tender leaves And you say the Ruler of the whole Land of Oz is in danger Hah well we all have our troubles Exhaling his breath noisily Shagomar looked off between the trees with a troubled frown I cannot direct you to the Emerald City but Im sure the Princess can help you What Princess do you mean asked the Wizard curious to hear what Shagomar would say Azarine whispered the Stag looking around carefully to see that no one was listening Azarine the Red Ruler of Red Top Mountain But I thought Bustabo was ruler of the mountain I just came from his castle sputtered the Wizard He certainly told me he was King of the Kudgers King of the Kudgers pfui The stag shook his head as if a bee were in his ear while his bell played a regular roundelay Bustabo was till a week ago Chief Bowman in Her Majestys Guard Using his position and his men to help him he has wickedly seized Azarines throne insisting that Azarine permit him to be the King of all the Kudgers When our little Princess refused she was locked up in the tower But with the assistance of a faithful servant she managed to escape and has been hiding in this forest ever since I being an old and trusted friend have been looking out for her and will protect her with horn and hoof until her own loyal subjects unseat this miserable imposter Whew so thats the way it is The Wizard thrust his hands more deeply into his pockets Well that settles that I wont do it no matter what happens Wont do what questioned the Stag looking down sideways at the little man Oh C4 nothing Kicking at a stone the Wizard walked along in a depressed silence Surely no one ever had been in a worse dilemma If he managed by a trick or by force to carry Azarine back to the Red Castle Dorothy and his friends would be released instantly and all of them speeded on their way to the Capitol If he did not return the Princess to the castle his brave and faithful companions would be flung off the mountain Strut would conquer the Emerald City and everything would be lost LOST But when a few minutes later the Stag pushed through a cluster of bushes that concealed the entrance to the cave and the Wizard stepped into the presence of Azarine herself he knew he never would force her to surrender to the infamous Bustabo Seated pensively on a rough boulder beside a small fire was the prettiest little Princess the Wizard had almost ever seen Her hair long and red as Glindas fell in satiny waves to her feet She wore a little mesh cap of pearls and a white satin Princess dress A long red velvet cloak hung loosely from her shoulders Not exactly the costume for a cave but vastly becoming Azarines pale and flowerlike face was sweet and gentle and when she saw the wet and weary traveler with Shagomar she jumped up to welcome h
