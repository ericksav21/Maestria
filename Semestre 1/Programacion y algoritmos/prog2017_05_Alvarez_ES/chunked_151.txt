h the radiance of the six great colored suns but still they gleamed steadily and clearly The Mangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any light that did not come directly from their suns Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor where it covered quite a broad surface When he lighted the oil a hundred tongues of flame shot up and the effect was really imposing Now Princess exclaimed the Wizard those of your advisors who wished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within this circle of light If they advised you well and were in the right they will not be injured in any way But if any advised you wrongly the light will wither him The advisors of the Princess did not like this test but she commanded them to step into the flame and one by one they did so and were scorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that of baked potatoes Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged from the fire and all were so withered that it would be necessary to plant them at once Sir said the Princess to the Wizard you are greater than any Sorcerer we have ever known As it is evident that my people have advised me wrongly I will not cast you three people into the dreadful Garden of the Clinging Vines but your animals must be driven into the Black Pit in the mountain for my subjects cannot bear to have them around The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself that he said nothing against this decree but when the Princess had gone both Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them from such a fate For two or three days after thisif we call days the periods between sleep there being no night to divide the hours into daysour friends were not disturbed in any way They were even permitted to occupy the House of the Sorcerer in peace as if it had been their own and to wander in the gardens in search of food Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines and walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest They saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and twisting around like a nest of great snakes Everything the vines touched they crushed and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have escaped being cast among them Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets from his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to amuse themselves and get some exercise and one time they found his glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part of the great dome walking through the air as easily as Eureka could They knew the kitten by this time so they scampered over to where she lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her The cabhorse who never slept long at a time sat upon his haunches and watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval Dont be rough he would call out if Eureka knocked over one of the round fat piglets with her paw but the pigs never minded and enjoyed the sport very greatly Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent solemneyed Mangaboos Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered with sharp thorns which was thrust defiantly toward the horse the kitten and the piglets Herestop this foolishness Jim roared angrily but after being pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way of the thorns The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks but left an opening to the doorway of the hall so the animals slowly retreated until they were driven from the room and out upon the street Here were more of the vegetable people with thorns and silently they urged the now frightened creatures down the street Jim had to be careful not to step upon the tiny piglets who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing while Eureka snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her also tried to protect the pretty little things from injury Slowly but steadily the heartless Mangaboos drove them on until they had passed through the city and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to the mountain What does all this mean anyhow asked the horse jumping to escape a thorn Why they are driving us toward the Black Pit into which they threatened to cast us replied the kitten If I were as big as you are Jim Id fight these miserable turniproots What would you do enquired Jim Id kick out with those long legs and ironshod hoofs All right said the horse Ill do it An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and kicked out his hind legs as hard as he could A dozen of them smashed together and tumbled to the ground and seeing his success Jim kicked again and again charging into the vegetable crowd knocking them in all directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron heels Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and scratc
