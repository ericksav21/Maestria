e and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks before him But now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid whirling and the travelers plainly saw a girls face appear in the center of each flower These lovely faces looked upon the astonished band with mocking smiles and then burst into a chorus of merry laughter at the dismay their appearance caused Stop stop cried Tip seizing the Woodmans arm theyre alive theyre girls At that moment the flowers began whirling again and the faces faded away and were lost in the rapid revolutions The Tin Woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground It would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures said he despondently and yet I do not know how else we can proceed upon our way They looked to me strangely like the faces of 138 the Army of Revolt mused the Scarecrow But I cannot conceive how the girls could have followed us here so quickly I believe its magic said Tip positively and that someone is playing a trick upon us Ive known old Mombi do things like that before Probably its nothing more than an illusion and there are no sunflowers here at all Then let us shut our eyes and walk forward suggested the Woodman Excuse me replied the Scarecrow My eyes are not painted to shut Because you happen to have tin eyelids you must not imagine we are all built in the same way And the eyes of the SawHorse are knot eyes said Jack leaning forward to examine them Nevertheless you must ride quickly forward commanded Tip and we will follow after you and so try to escape My eyes are already so dazzled that I can scarcely see So the Pumpkinhead rode boldly forward and Tip grasped the stub tail of the SawHorse and followed with closed eyes The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman brought up the rear and before they had gone many yards a Joyful shout from Jack announced that the way was clear before them 139 Then all paused to look backward but not a trace of the field of sunflowers remained More cheerfully now they proceeded upon their Journey but old Mombi had so changed the appearance of the landscape that they would surely have been lost had not the Scarecrow wisely concluded to take their direction from the sun For no witchcraft could change the course of the sun and it was therefore a safe guide However other difficulties lay before them The SawHorse stepped into a rabbit hole and fell to the ground The Pumpkinhead was pitched high into the air and his history would probably have ended at that exact moment had not the Tin Woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it descended and saved it from injury Tip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced Jack upon his feet But the SawHorse did not escape so easily For when his leg was pulled from the rabbit hole it was found to be broken short off and must be replaced or repaired before he could go a step farther This is quite serious said the Tin Woodman If there were trees near by I might soon manufacture another leg for this animal but I cannot see even a shrub for miles around 140 Full page lineart drawing THE TIN WOODMAN SKILLFULLY CAUGHT THE PUMPKIN 141 And there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of Oz added the Scarecrow disconsolately Then what shall we do enquired the boy I suppose I must start my brains working replied his Majesty the Scarecrow for experience has taught me that I can do anything if I but take time to think it out Let us all think said Tip and perhaps we shall find a way to repair the SawHorse So they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think while the SawHorse occupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb Does it hurt asked the Tin Woodman in a soft sympathetic voice Not in the least returned the SawHorse but my pride is injured to find that my anatomy is so brittle For a time the little group remained in silent thought Presently the Tin Woodman raised his head and looked over the fields What sort of creature is that which approaches us he asked wonderingly The others followed his gaze and discovered coming toward them the most extraordinary object they had ever beheld It advanced quickly and 142 noiselessly over the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the adventurers and regarded them with an astonishment equal to their own The Scarecrow was calm under all circumstances Good morning he said politely The stranger removed his hat with a flourish bowed very low and then responded LineArt Drawing Good morning one and all I hope you are as an aggregation enjoying excellent health Permit me to present my card With this courteous speech it extended a card toward the Scarecrow who accepted it turned it over and over and handed it with a shake of his head to Tip The boy read aloud MR H M WOGGLEBUG T E 143 Dear me ejaculated the Pumpkinhead staring somewhat intently How very peculiar said the Tin Woodman Tips eyes were round and wondering and the SawHorse uttered a sigh and turned away its head Are you really a WoggleBug enquired the Scarecrow Most certainly m
