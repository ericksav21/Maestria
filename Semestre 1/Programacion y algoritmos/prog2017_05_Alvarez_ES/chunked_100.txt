ar you into little bits Why are you so cruel to me asked Dorothy Im a stranger in your country and have done you no harm No harm cried one who seemed to be their leader Did you not pick our lunchboxes and dinnerpails Have you not a stolen dinnerpail still in your hand I only picked one of each she answered I was hungry and I didnt know the trees were yours That is no excuse retorted the leader who was clothed in a most gorgeous suit It is the law here that whoever picks a dinnerpail without our permission must die immediately Dont you believe him said Billina Im sure the trees do not belong to these awful creatures They are fit for any mischief and its my opinion they would try to kill us just the same if you hadnt picked a dinnerpail I think so too agreed Dorothy But what shall we do now Stay where we are advised the yellow hen We are safe from the Wheelers until we starve to death anyhow and before that time comes a good many things can happen 4 Tiktok the Machine Man After an hour or so most of the band of Wheelers rolled back into the forest leaving only three of their number to guard the hill These curled themselves up like big dogs and pretended to go to sleep on the sands but neither Dorothy nor Billina were fooled by this trick so they remained in security among the rocks and paid no attention to their cunning enemies Finally the hen fluttering over the mound exclaimed Why heres a path So Dorothy at once clambered to where Billina sat and there sure enough was a smooth path cut between the rocks It seemed to wind around the mound from top to bottom like a corkscrew twisting here and there between the rough boulders but always remaining level and easy to walk upon Indeed Dorothy wondered at first why the Wheelers did not roll up this path but when she followed it to the foot of the mound she found that several big pieces of rock had been placed directly across the end of the way thus preventing any one outside from seeing it and also preventing the Wheelers from using it to climb up the mound Then Dorothy walked back up the path and followed it until she came to the very top of the hill where a solitary round rock stood that was bigger than any of the others surrounding it The path came to an end just beside this great rock and for a moment it puzzled the girl to know why the path had been made at all But the hen who had been gravely following her around and was now perched upon a point of rock behind Dorothy suddenly remarked It looks something like a door doesnt it What looks like a door enquired the child Why that crack in the rock just facing you replied Billina whose little round eyes were very sharp and seemed to see everything It runs up one side and down the other and across the top and the bottom What does Why the crack So I think it must be a door of rock although I do not see any hinges Oh yes said Dorothy now observing for the first time the crack in the rock And isnt this a keyhole Billina pointing to a round deep hole at one side of the door Of course If we only had the key now we could unlock it and see what is there replied the yellow hen May be its a treasure chamber full of diamonds and rubies or heaps of shining gold or That reminds me said Dorothy of the golden key I picked up on the shore Do you think that it would fit this keyhole Billina Try it and see suggested the hen So Dorothy searched in the pocket of her dress and found the golden key And when she had put it into the hole of the rock and turned it a sudden sharp snap was heard then with a solemn creak that made the shivers run down the childs back the face of the rock fell outward like a door on hinges and revealed a small dark chamber just inside Good gracious cried Dorothy shrinking back as far as the narrow path would let her For standing within the narrow chamber of rock was the form of a manor at least it seemed like a man in the dim light He was only about as tall as Dorothy herself and his body was round as a ball and made out of burnished copper Also his head and limbs were copper and these were jointed or hinged to his body in a peculiar way with metal caps over the joints like the armor worn by knights in days of old He stood perfectly still and where the light struck upon his form it glittered as if made of pure gold Dont be frightened called Billina from her perch It isnt alive I see it isnt replied the girl drawing a long breath It is only made out of copper like the old kettle in the barnyard at home continued the hen turning her head first to one side and then to the other so that both her little round eyes could examine the object Once said Dorothy I knew a man made out of tin who was a woodman named Nick Chopper But he was as alive as we are cause he was born a real man and got his tin body a little at a timefirst a leg and then a finger and then an earfor the reason that he had so many accidents with his axe and cut himself up in a very careless manner Oh said the hen with a sniff as if she did not belie
