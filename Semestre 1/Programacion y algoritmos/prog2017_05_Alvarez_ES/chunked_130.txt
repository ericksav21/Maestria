ue him agreed the Scarecrow sadly Poor Nick I wonder what has become of him And he owed me six weeks back pay said one of the generals wiping the tears from his eyes with his goldlaced coat sleeve Very sorrowfully they determined to return to the upper world without their former companion and so Ozma gave the order to begin the march through the passage The army went first and then the royal family of Ev and afterward came Dorothy Ozma Billina the Scarecrow and Tiktok They left the Nome King scowling at them from his throne and had no thought of danger until Ozma chanced to look back and saw a large number of the warriors following them in full chase with their swords and spears and axes raised to strike down the fugitives as soon as they drew near enough Evidently the Nome King had made this last attempt to prevent their escaping him but it did him no good for when Dorothy saw the danger they were in she stopped and waved her hand and whispered a command to the magic belt Instantly the foremost warriors became eggs which rolled upon the floor of the cavern in such numbers that those behind could not advance without stepping upon them But when they saw the eggs all desire to advance departed from the warriors and they turned and fled madly into the cavern and refused to go back again Our friends had no further trouble in reaching the end of the passage and soon were standing in the outer air upon the gloomy path between the two high mountains But the way to Ev lay plainly before them and they fervently hoped that they had seen the last of the Nome King and of his dreadful palace The cavalcade was led by Ozma mounted on the Cowardly Lion and the Queen of Ev who rode upon the back of the Tiger The children of the Queen walked behind her hand in hand Dorothy rode the Sawhorse while the Scarecrow walked and commanded the army in the absence of the Tin Woodman Presently the way began to lighten and more of the sunshine to come in between the two mountains And before long they heard the thump thump thump of the giants hammer upon the road How may we pass the monstrous man of iron asked the Queen anxious for the safety of her children But Dorothy solved the problem by a word to the magic belt The giant paused with his hammer held motionless in the air thus allowing the entire party to pass between his castiron legs in safety 19 The King of Ev If there were any shifting rockcolored Nomes on the mountain side now they were silent and respectful for our adventurers were not annoyed as before by their impudent laughter Really the Nomes had nothing to laugh at since the defeat of their King On the other side they found Ozmas golden chariot standing as they had left it Soon the Lion and the Tiger were harnessed to the beautiful chariot in which was enough room for Ozma and the Queen and six of the royal children Little Evring preferred to ride with Dorothy upon the Sawhorse which had a long back The Prince had recovered from his shyness and had become very fond of the girl who had rescued him so they were fast friends and chatted pleasantly together as they rode along Billina was also perched upon the head of the wooden steed which seemed not to mind the added weight in the least and the boy was full of wonder that a hen could talk and say such sensible things When they came to the gulf Ozmas magic carpet carried them all over in safety and now they began to pass the trees in which birds were singing and the breeze that was wafted to them from the farms of Ev was spicy with flowers and newmown hay and the sunshine fell full upon them to warm them and drive away from their bodies the chill and dampness of the underground kingdom of the Nomes I would be quite content said the Scarecrow to Tiktok were only the Tin Woodman with us But it breaks my heart to leave him behind He was a fine fellow replied Tiktok although his material was not very durable Oh tin is an excellent material the Scarecrow hastened to say and if anything ever happened to poor Nick Chopper he was always easily soldered Besides he did not have to be wound up and was not liable to get out of order I sometimes wish said Tiktok that I was stuffed with straw as you are It is hard to be made of copper I have no reason to complain of my lot replied the Scarecrow A little fresh straw now and then makes me as good as new But I can never be the polished gentleman that my poor departed friend the Tin Woodman was You may be sure the royal children of Ev and their Queen mother were delighted at seeing again their beloved country and when the towers of the palace of Ev came into view they could not forbear cheering at the sight Little Evring riding in front of Dorothy was so overjoyed that he took a curious tin whistle from his pocket and blew a shrill blast that made the Sawhorse leap and prance in sudden alarm What is that asked Billina who had been obliged to flutter her wings in order to keep her seat upon the head of the frightened Sawhorse Thats my whistle sai
