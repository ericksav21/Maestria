 clear intelligent eyes a tawney mane bushy and well kept and a body like yellow plush The other was a great Tiger with purple stripes around his lithe body powerful limbs and eyes that showed through the half closed lids like coals of fire The huge forms of these monarchs of the forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutest heart and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them But the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone saying This noble Horse is my friend the Cowardly Lion who is the valiant King of the Forest but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess Ozma And this is the Hungry Tiger the terror of the jungle who longs to devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so These royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have come to the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland Hearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm He bowed his head with as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage looking beasts who in return nodded in a friendly way Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal asked the Sawhorse admiringly That is doubtless a matter of taste returned the Lion In the forest he would be thought ungainly because his face is stretched out and his neck is uselessly long His joints I notice are swollen and overgrown and he lacks flesh and is old in years And dreadfully tough added the Hungry Tiger in a sad voice My conscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the Real Horse Im glad of that said Jim for I also have a conscience and it tells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof If he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he was mistaken The Tiger seemed to smile and winked one eye slowly You have a good conscience friend Horse it said and if you attend to its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm Some day I will let you try to crush in my skull and afterward you will know more about tigers than you do now Any friend of Dorothy remarked the Cowardly Lion must be our friend as well So let us cease this talk of skull crushing and converse upon more pleasant subjects Have you breakfasted Sir Horse Not yet replied Jim But here is plenty of excellent clover so if you will excuse me I will eat now Hes a vegetarian remarked the Tiger as the horse began to munch the clover If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience for nothing could then tempt me to devour babies and lambs Just then Dorothy who had risen early and heard the voices of the animals ran out to greet her old friends She hugged both the Lion and the Tiger with eager delight but seemed to love the King of Beasts a little better than she did his hungry friend having known him longer By this time they had indulged in a good talk and Dorothy had told them all about the awful earthquake and her recent adventures the breakfast bell rang from the palace and the little girl went inside to join her human comrades As she entered the great hall a voice called out in a rather harsh tone What are YOU here again Yes I am she answered looking all around to see where the voice came from What brought you back was the next question and Dorothys eye rested on an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace and caught its lips in the act of moving Good gracious she exclaimed I thought you were stuffed So I am replied the head But once on a time I was part of the Gump which Ozma sprinkled with the Powder of Life I was then for a time the Head of the finest Flying Machine that was ever known to exist and we did many wonderful things Afterward the Gump was taken apart and I was put back on this wall but I can still talk when I feel in the mood which is not often Its very strange said the girl What were you when you were first alive That I have forgotten replied the Gumps Head and I do not think it is of much importance But here comes Ozma so Id better hush up for the Princess doesnt like me to chatter since she changed her name from Tip to Ozma Just then the girlish Ruler of Oz opened the door and greeted Dorothy with a goodmorning kiss The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy and in good spirits Breakfast is served dear she said and I am hungry So dont let us keep it waiting a single minute 17 The Nine Tiny Piglets After breakfast Ozma announced that she had ordered a holiday to be observed throughout the Emerald City in honor of her visitors The people had learned that their old Wizard had returned to them and all were anxious to see him again for he had always been a rare favorite So first there was to be a grand procession through the streets after which the little old man was requested to perform some of his wizardries in the great Throne Room of the palace In the afternoon there were to be games and races The procession was very imposing First came the Imperial Cornet Band of Oz dressed in emerald velvet uniforms with slashes of peagreen satin and buttons of immense cut emeralds The
