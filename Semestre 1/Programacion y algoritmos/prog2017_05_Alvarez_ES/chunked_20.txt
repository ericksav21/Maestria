d up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room And at last they looked at Dorothy again Why should I do this for you asked Oz Because you are strong and I am weak because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a little girl But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East said Oz That just happened returned Dorothy simply I could not help it Well said the Head I will give you my answer You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first Help me and I will help you What must I do asked the girl Kill the Wicked Witch of the West answered Oz But I cannot exclaimed Dorothy greatly surprised You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansasbut not before The little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him if she would I never killed anything willingly she sobbed Even if I wanted to how could I kill the Wicked Witch If you who are Great and Terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it I do not know said the Head but that is my answer and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again Remember that the Witch is Wickedtremendously Wickedand ought to be killed Now go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her There is no hope for me she said sadly for Oz will not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West and that I can never do Her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so Dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said Come with me for Oz has sent for you So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely Lady She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels Growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them When the Scarecrow had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said I am Oz the Great and Terrible Who are you and why do you seek me Now the Scarecrow who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely I am only a Scarecrow stuffed with straw Therefore I have no brains and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions Why should I do this for you asked the Lady Because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the Scarecrow I never grant favors without some return said Oz but this much I will promise If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West I will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch said the Scarecrow in surprise So I did I dont care who kills her But until she is dead I will not grant your wish Now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had said and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head as she had seen him but a lovely Lady All the same said the Scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said Oz has sent for you Follow me So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room He did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head but he hoped it would be the lovely Lady For he said to himself if it is the head I am sure I shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast It was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face There were five
