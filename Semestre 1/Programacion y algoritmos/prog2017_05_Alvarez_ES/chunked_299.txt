n iron ring in the ships hull and made the raft fast There was a runway at the back of the raft and the rails on that side let down so that Nikobo had no trouble clambering aboard By pulling a rope with her teeth she could raise or lower the back of her pen and take a swim whenever she felt the need of one After giving her a bit of advice about voyaging and seeing her comfortably settled Samuel climbed the cable and nimbly pulled himself aboard his ship Roger had already stowed their precious specimens in the hold and rubbing his hands with brisk satisfaction the Captain of the Crescent Moon weighed anchor and dropped with the tide down the Biggenlittle River to the sea Then touching the automatic controls he set his sails to catch the evening breeze adjusted his steering gear for a course east by soueast and strode happily into his cabin The Salamander chirped cheerfully as he passed her hotbox and after tapping a cheerful greeting on the lid the weary explorer stripped off his ruined and muddy shoregoing outfit took a shower and climbed thankfully back into his old sea clothes Wheres the pest he called out as Roger flew past the open port Well since he was so small and important sniffed the Read Bird waving a claw I gave him a large cabin to himself I didnt think you and Ato would want him in here Shiver my timbers NO Samuel looked ruefully across at the small berth the Philadelphia boy occupied on their last voyage Hell never be the seaman Peter was or the company either Hed better keep out of my way C4 HAH C4 or Ill give him a taste of my belt Snatching up his spyglass and looking as stern as a kindhearted pirate well can Samuel hurried out on deck Meanwhile in the cabin next to the Captains Tandy stood regarding himself mournfully in the small glass over his sea chest He too had taken a shower and at Rogers suggestion had donned one of Peters old pirate suits I am a King and the son of a Kings son muttered Tandy staring sadly at the sallow reflection in the mirror To tell the truth the suit was not in the least becoming to the skinny and sullen young monarch I am a King and son of a Kings son and can bear anything he repeated dismally Then bear a hand with the dinner yelled Roger who had been peeking at him through the porthole All who eat must work and under the hatches with lubbers Pretending not to hear Tandy sat resignedly on the side of his bunk though he really was curious to look around the ship and see what Kobo was doing From the galley came the cheerful rattle of pots and pans and the huge voice of Ato singing as he prepared the dinner Gulls flew in excited circles all round the Crescent Moon calling out their hoarse challenge and farewell and Samuel Salt leaning on the taffrail gazed dreamily back at Patrippany Island The Oz flags fluttering from the tall palms gave it quite a gay and festive appearance and in spite of not seeing the Leopard Men Samuel felt he had done a good days discovering Ahoy below How you coming called Samuel leaning down to look at Nikobo The hippopotamus wagged her huge head Fine Just fine mate she wheezed pleasantly Hah Good for you Samuels face broke into a broad grin as Kobo remembered to call him Mate Well make an ablebodied seawoman of you yet my lass CHAPTER 8 MAXIMS FOR MONARCHS When Ato banging boisterously on an iron frying pan with a wooden spoon summoned all hands to dinner Samuel and Roger responded with a rush But Tandy remained sitting gloomily on his bunk Now whats the matter demanded Samuel Salt as Roger sent to call the young voyager came flying back to the table He says I may serve his dinner in the cabin snickered Roger popping a biscuit into his mouth and swallowing it whole Well dont you do it roared the Captain bringing his fist down with an angry thump No use to start such nonsense But hes so thin and feeble The poor childs just full of raw roots and jungle grass murmured Ato beginning to heap a platter with meat and vegetables Wait till he folds himself round some of these seafarin rations Hell be a different person And hed better be rumbled the Captain of the Crescent Moon pulling in his chair And if you and Roger want to spoil the little pest go ahead but hed better keep out of MY way HAH I could drop the dinner on his head suggested Roger helpfully as Ato handed him an appetizing tray for Tandy How would that be Utterly reprehensible and conduct unbecoming in a Royal Read Bird and ablebodied seaman chuckled the ships cook shaking his finger at Roger Why dont you try to help the little beggar and set him a good example Now Roger in spite of his sharp tongue was really a sociable and kindhearted bird and the sight of Tandy sitting so forlornly on his bunk made him regret his teasing speeches After all the little fellow was far from home and had had a hard time in the jungle Here he puffed setting down the tray and lighting the lantern Thisll put feathers on your chest young one and mind you eat every scrap Thank you answered Tandy so drearily
