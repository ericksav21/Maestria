y fall off Oh no said Dorothy weve been there and we know The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place resumed the Wizard but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own for long Even if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary in order to reach the earths surface to keep moving on toward it In that case said the man it will be best for you to cross our Valley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain The top of that mountain is lost in the clouds and when you reach it you will be in the awful Land of Naught where the Gargoyles live What are Gargoyles asked Zeb I do not know young sir Our greatest Champion OvermanAnu once climbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoyles before he could escape them and come back but he could never be induced to describe the dreadful creatures and soon afterward a bear caught him and ate him up The wanders were rather discouraged by this gloomy report but Dorothy said with a sigh If the only way to get home is to meet the Gurgles then weve got to meet em They cant be worse than the Wicked Witch or the Nome King But you must remember you had the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to help you conquer those enemies suggested the Wizard Just now my dear there is not a single warrior in your company Oh I guess Zeb could fight if he had to Couldnt you Zeb asked the little girl Perhaps if I had to answered Zeb doubtfully And you have the jointed sword that you chopped the vegtable Sorcerer in two with the girl said to the little man True he replied and in my satchel are other useful things to fight with What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise said the mans voice Our Champion told me that when he shouted his battlecry the creatures shuddered and drew back hesitating to continue the combat But they were in great numbers and the Champion could not shout much because he had to save his breath for fighting Very good said the Wizard we can all yell better than we can fight so we ought to defeat the Gargoyles But tell me said Dorothy how did such a brave Champion happen to let the bears eat him And if he was invisble and the bears invisble who knows that they really ate him up The Champion had killed eleven bears in his time returned the unseen man and we know this is true because when any creature is dead the invisible charm of the damafruit ceases to be active and the slain one can be plainly seen by all eyes When the Champion killed a bear everyone could see it and when the bears killed the Champion we all saw several pieces of him scattered about which of course disappeared again when the bears devoured them They now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage and after the man had called their attention to a high pyramidshaped mountain on the opposite side of the Valley and told them how to travel in order to reach it they again started upon their journey They followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more pretty cottages but of course they saw no one nor did any one speak to them Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about and there were many of the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of About noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a pretty orchard and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plums that grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them There are bears near by Be careful The Wizard got out his sword at once and Zeb grabbed the horsewhip Dorothy climbed into the buggy although Jim had been unharnessed from it and was grazing some distance away The owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said You cannot escape the bears that way How CAN we scape asked Dorothy nervously for an unseen danger is always the hardest to face You must take to the river was the reply The bears will not venture upon the water But we would be drowned exclaimed the girl Oh there is no need of that said the voice which from its gentle tones seemed to belong to a young girl You are strangers in the Valley of Voe and do not seem to know our ways so I will try to save you The next moment a broadleaved plant was jerked from the ground where it grew and held suspended in the air before the Wizard Sir said the voice you must rub these leaves upon the soles of all your feet and then you will be able to walk upon the water without sinking below the surface It is a secret the bears do not know and we people of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel and so escape our enemies Thank you cried the Wizard joyfully and at once rubbed a leaf upon the soles of Dorothys shoes and then upon his own The girl took a leaf and rubbed it upon the kittens paws and the rest of the plant was handed to Zeb who after applying it to his own feet carefully rubbed it upon all four of Jims hoofs and then upon the tires of the buggywheels He had nearly finished this last task when a low growling was suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciously with his heels
