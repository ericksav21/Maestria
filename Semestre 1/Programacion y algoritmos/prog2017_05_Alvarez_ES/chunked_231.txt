CHAPTER 1 THE KING OF SKAMPAVIA Is this all The King of Skampavia frowned at the great stack of bags bales crates and carriers heaped around his throne Leaning forward he gingerly extracted a fig from one of the baskets and popped it into his enormous mouth Pah dry as a blotter spluttered the redfaced ruler gritting his teeth with disgust and look at those cocoanuts no bigger round than a babys rattle Leaping off his throne he began kicking at the baskets of vegetables and bales of cotton and other merchandise What dusty junk is this he raged glaring furiously at Pinny Penny his patient Prime Minister How dare they send me such stuff Clasping and unclasping his hands nervously Pinny Penny nevertheless spoke up boldly Because they have nothing better your Majesty What can our poor subjects do with land so unprofitable and barren Then not only must they produce enough for their own needs but are required by the law to give onethird of all they raise to the crown And why not blustered Skamperoo settling back argumentatively on his throne I am the KING You cant get around that you know No sighed Pinny Penny and drawing aside one of the shabby curtains he looked sorrowfully out into the courtyard Whats all that racket demanded his Master as a medley of shouts roars and dull thuds came rolling up to them Forgetting his anger for a moment he bounded to his feet and came across the room to look over Pinny Pennys shoulder A slight argument seems to have arisen among the Supervisors murmured Pinny Penny resignedly Now Skampavia I must tell you is roughly divided into seven counties and over each county Skamperoo had set a Supervisor whose duty it was to govern the province and to turn over to him onethird of all produce and merchandise in that county To save time and easily identify them the supervisors were known by the size of the counties they governed For instance the Supervisor of the First County which was one mile wide and ten miles long was called Onebyten the Supervisor of the Second County Twobyfour and the others were variously known as Threebysix Ninebyfive Eightbyeight Fivebynine and Fourbyseven Twice a year the Supervisors rode into the capital with their tribute and now down in the courtyard the seven tremendous Skampavians were in a perfect pitched battle helped out by all the guards and palace servants Argument roared the King slapping Pinny Penny rudely on the shoulder Its a fight and you know it Ho ho Just look at the goodfornothing rascals I tell you old Two Pins however poorly they serve us as farmers and merchants our Skampavians can certainly fight And who says Im too hard on them Have I not given every man Jack a dress uniform and gun and made them learn military drilling and marching at the Royal College And what use is all this drilling and marching inquired Pinny Penny wearily Letting the curtain fall he hurried away for well he knew if he did not put a stop to the conflict in the courtyard every window in the palace would be broken Now what did he mean by that muttered Skamperoo peevishly as his little Prime Minister whisked out of sight Pursing his lips he seated himself heavily on his throne After all Pinny Penny had only spoken the truth Why had his father or his fathers father ever picked out this pesky little country in the first place Located in the southern part of the desert of Noland between the Kingdoms of Ix and Merryland Skampavia he was forced to admit had neither riches beauty nor interest His castle though poor and shabby was comfortable enough and having lived in it all his life he was used to it He had put up with the hot dry climate and the poor quality of the food but after all why should he continue to do so In those longago days in the schoolroom he had studied of energetic rulers who had taken their armies and gone forth to conquer richer and more desirable lands from their neighbors Well then why should not he take his men push over the border into a more fertile and kindly land The idea pleased but at the same time annoyed him Skamperoo was fat and lazy He loved quiet and ease and the thought of a hard military campaign made him shudder with distaste Still he reflected remembering Pinny Pennys reproachful face a King should do something for his subjects and the more he did for them C4 Ho ho C4 the more he could make them do for him A rich and prosperous country meant a rich and prosperous ruler Discontentedly fingering the rough cloth from which his royal robes were fashioned he began to picture himself decked out in splendid satins and velvets heavily encrusted with jewels Jewels Pah All the jewels he had were his plain gold scepter badly dented and bent from hurling at Pinny Penny Taking off the crown he scowled at it critically and began considering the realms on either side of his own dominions To the north there was nothing but a sandy strip of desert and the tossing waters of the Nonestic Ocean East lay the Kingdom of Ix and Zixie sic the little Queen he consi
