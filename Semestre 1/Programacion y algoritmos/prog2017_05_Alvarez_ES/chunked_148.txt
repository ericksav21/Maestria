 very comforting and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure The children feeling sad and despondent were about to follow him when the Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder Wait he whispered What for asked the girl Suppose we pick the Royal Princess said the Wizard Im quite sure shes ripe and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler and may treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to All right exclaimed Dorothy eagerly Lets pick her while we have the chance before the man with the star comes back So together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one hand of the lovely Princess Pull cried Dorothy and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward them and the stems snapped and separated from her feet She was not at all heavy so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to the ground The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant tucked in a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged and after a look around the garden made those present a gracious bow and said in a sweet but even toned voice I thank you very much We salute your Royal Highness cried the Wizard kneeling and kissing her hand Just then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten and a moment later he returned to the enclosure followed by a number of his people Instantly the Princess turned and faced him and when he saw that she was picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble Sir said the Royal Lady with much dignity you have wronged me greatly and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers come to my rescue I have been ready for picking all the past week but because you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule you left me to stand silent upon my bush I did not know that you were ripe answered the Prince in a low voice Give me the Star of Royalty she commanded Slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon that of the Princess Then all the people bowed low to her and the Prince turned and walked away alone What became of him afterward our friends never knew The people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and marched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace and to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion But while the people in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked in the air just above their heads to show that she was a superior being and more exalted than her subjects No one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers so Dorothy and Zeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselves into the vegetable gardens They did not bother to cross the bridges over the brooks but when they came to a stream they stepped high and walked in the air to the other side This was a very interesting experience to them and Dorothy said I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air Perhaps answered the Wizard it is because we are close to the center of the earth where the attraction of gravitation is very slight But Ive noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries Is this a fairy country asked the boy Of course it is returned Dorothy promptly Only a fairy country could have vegtable people and only in a fairy country could Eureka and Jim talk as we do Thats true said Zeb thoughtfully In the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons and several other unknown but delicious fruits of which they ate heartily But the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat and called the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk by means of his magical arts As they sat upon the grass watching Jim who was still busily eating Eureka said I dont believe you are a Wizard at all No answered the little man you are quite right In the strict sense of the word I am not a Wizard but only a humbug The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug agreed Dorothy Ive known him for a long time If that is so said the boy how could he do that wonderful trick with the nine tiny piglets Dont know said Dorothy but it must have been humbug Very true declared the Wizard nodding at her It was necessary to deceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince as well as their stupid people but I dont mind telling you who are my friends that the thing was only a trick But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes exclaimed Zeb So did I purred the kitten To be sure answered the Wizard You saw them because they were there They are in my inside pocket now But the pulling of them apart and pushing them together again was only a sleightofhand trick Lets see the pigs said Eureka eagerly The little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny piglets setting them upon the grass one by one where they ran around and nibbled the tender blades Theyre hungry too he said Oh what cunning things cried Dorothy catching up one and petting it Be careful said the piglet with a squeal youre squeezing me Dear me murmured th
