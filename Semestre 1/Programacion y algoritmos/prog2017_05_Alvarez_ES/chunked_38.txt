urned up his nose in disgust Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair It had a great mouth with a row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasps waist This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monsters back Then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spiders head from its body Jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite dead The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly You need fear your enemy no longer Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas 22 The Country of the Quadlings The four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock That will be a hard climb said the Scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless So he led the way and the others followed They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out Keep back Who are you asked the Scarecrow Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said This hill belongs to us and we dont allow anyone to cross it But we must cross it said the Scarecrow Were going to the country of the Quadlings But you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen He was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles But he had no arms at all and seeing this the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill So he said Im sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward As quick as lightning the mans head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said It isnt as easy as you think A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless HammerHeads upon the hillside one behind every rock The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrows mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill Again a head shot swiftly out and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet and the Lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said It is useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them What can we do then she asked Call the Winged Monkeys suggested the Tin Woodman You have still the right to command them once more Very well she answered and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered the magic words The Monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few moments the entire band stood before her What are your commands inquired the King of the Monkeys bowing low Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings answered the girl It shall be done said the King and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them As they passed over the hill the HammerHeads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings This is the last time you can summon us said the leader to Dorothy so goodbye and good luck to you Goodbye and thank you very much returned the girl and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy There was field upon field of ripening grain with wellpaved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins The Quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and goodnatured were dressed all in red which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door It was opened by the farmers wife and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk for Toto How far is it to t
