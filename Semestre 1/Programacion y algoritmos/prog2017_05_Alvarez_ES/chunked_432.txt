ead us into the castle ordered Jellia sharply Bring us soup meat bread vegetables and plenty of fruit and cake Bustabo after a long look both at Jellia and the Wizard motioned for the Bowmen to lead the visitors into the castle The Cowardly Lion trailed suspiciously along in the rear keeping a sharp watch to see that no beards were pointed at his friends The Wizard accompanied them part way conversing in earnest whispers with Jellia and Dorothy Wantowin Battles supported the dripping and stillhelpless Scarecrow and each tried not to show the anxiety he felt when the Wizard finally turned to leave them Goodbye all he said lifting his dripping hat Goodbye Jellia here is your bag Tapping the kitbag significantly he pressed it into Jellias cold hands Then without a word to Bustabo or his Henchmen he strode resolutely toward the dark forest that covered the sides and more than half of the top of the mountain Relenting a little the Red King sent a Bowman running after him with a basket of provisions Taking the basket with a brief nod of thanks the Wizard waved again to his friends and marched straight into the gloomy and forbidding woods CHAPTER 14 AZARINE THE RED The late afternoon shadows made the forest seem even gloomier The little Wizard trudging along under the rustling red trees hands thrust deep into his pockets never had felt more depressed or unhappy He had hated to leave his friends with a Monarch as cruel and untrustworthy as Bustabo Still he had the utmost confidence in Jellia Jam The Young Oz Miss doubtless had some plan in her clever little head and had chosen this way for him to escape meaning to follow with the others at the first opportunity Anyway he reflected dropping down on a heap of fallen leaves and resting his back against a tree they had the kitbag to help them if worst came to worst Perhaps if he had concentrated and thought very hard he could recall the powerful incantation for locating missing persons and articles But a wizard without his books and equipment is almost as helpless as a doctor without his pills and medicine bag Try as he could the Wizard could not remember the proper combination of words to bring back the missing Princess His short nap in Stratovania had rested him a little but he still was dreadfully weary from his grueling flight and the recent shocks and mischances The loss of the Ozpril had been the worst blow of all and now his tired brain simply refused to work So sitting sadly under the tree he munched the sandwiches from the basket drank from the bottle of cold tea and wished fervently for a fire to warm himself for his clothes were still damp and clammy from the dive in Bustabos lake It comforted him a little to know that the others were drying out and enjoying a good supper in the castle But it was no comfort at all to realize that Strut and his legions were winging their way toward the Emerald City the city he had built and lived in so long it seemed more like home than any place he had known in America The Wizard crammed the rest of the sandwiches into the basket and started recklessly through the forest tripping over tough vines and rocks bumping into trees and peering desperately about for traces of a Princess or for any sign that might tell him in which direction the Emerald City lay From the slant of the ground he knew he was traveling down the mountain and the deep red foliage told him he was somewhere in the Quadling country of Oz But with night coming on and the shadows growing deeper and darker he probably would lose his way entirely and never get out of the forest at all He felt uneasy at leaving his comrades behind in the Red Kings Castle Was it better to try to save Ozma and the Emerald City or to stay in this forest and help Dorothy and Jellia and the devoted friends who had embarked on this unexpected adventure with him Stopping short the Wizard pressed both hands to his forehead in an effort to make up his mind Night already had overtaken him and it was now so dark it was impossible to see more than a foot or so in any direction Occasional roars the snapping of twigs and the gleam of yellow eyes from the thicket caused him no little anxiety At an especially savage roar he suddenly stopped worrying about Ozma and the others and began to do considerable worrying about himself How humbling for a Wizard to be devoured by a hungry beast Backing softly away from the approaching monster he began looking sharply about for a hollow tree a cave or even a clump of bushes where he might conceal himself On the tip of his tongue and ready for instant use was the magic word that would render him invisible Fortunately he did remember that But the Wizard never wasted words magic or otherwise Resolving to wait till the last possible moment he continued to back rapidly and cautiously Then unexpectedly from behind him came another distraction the clear ringing of a silver bell At the same time the gloom was pierced by a dancing ray of light Swinging round the Wiza
