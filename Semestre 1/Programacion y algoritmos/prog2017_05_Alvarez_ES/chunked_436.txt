 the Scarecrow pushed they moved creakily outward Quick Come help me urged the Scarecrow dragging the terrified and only halfawake Soldier to the window On with those parachute suits girls Well jump before were tossed out Dorothy and Jellia exchanged desperate glances and then C4 as the steps on the stair thumped louder and nearer C4 each grabbed a fallingout suit and zipped herself tidily inside Here panted Jellia down on her hands and knees beside the Cowardly Lion You can put your front feet in anyway and anything will be better than nothing when you fall To her relief and surprise she discovered that the pajamas would stretch Even the lion could wear them without too much discomfort Except for a cramp in his tail which was coiled tightly on his back the lion fitted into his pajamas nicely As the Soldier with Green Whiskers was trembling too violently to help himself or anyone else Jellia jerked and pushed him into one of the fallingout suits Then picking up the Wizards kitbag and looking solemnly back at her anxious comrades Jellia climbed to the window sill Ill go first she announced closing her mouth to keep her teeth from chattering No Let me I insist on going first cried the Scarecrow springing nimbly up beside Jellia Falling does not hurt me at all Oh hurry Hurry begged Dorothy glancing fearfully over her shoulder The footsteps were now so loud and near she expected the door to burst right open and Bustabos red face to appear Goodbye Im off Before the Scarecrow could stop her Jellia was off indeed Clutching the kitbag to her bosom she squeezed through the opening between the bars and dove headlong into space Next the Scarecrow with a sad little wave to Dorothy dropped out of sight Help me push this socalled Soldier out puffed Dorothy as the Cowardly Lion signalled for her to go next If we leave him till last hell never jump at all Halt About face Help Mama Papa Help Help HELP wailed Wantowin Battles But Dorothy relentlessly forced him to the sill and through the op ening As his wildly thrashing legs disappeared over the edge whoever was coming up the stairs broke into a run Thump thump THUMPETYTHUMP Trembling in every muscle Dorothy climbed to the sill Spreading both arms she launched herself into the air She heard the grunt of the Cowardly Lion as he forced his way through the opening Then the fierce rush of wind past her ears as she pitched downward drowned out all other sounds At first she was sure the Wizards fallingout suits were failures for the lion plunged past her falling like a plummet She too was whirling downward so fast she felt sure she would be crushed on the rocks below Closing her eyes she tried to resign herself to whatever was coming Then suddenly the pajamas filled with air ballooning out till she floated lightly as a feather The question now was would she ever come down There was no moon and in the faint starlight she could make out three other bulky shapes spinning through the air just beneath her By kicking her legs and flapping her arms Dorothy managed to miss several jutting rocks and tree limbs As she floated lower the suit began gradually to deflate finally letting her down as softly as could be on a strip of sand at the base of the mountain A little distance away she could see Jellia already stepping out of her fallingout suit and the Cowardly Lion waiting impatiently for someone to help him out of his Wantowin Battles very brave now that the danger was past already had stripped off his flying suit and was shaking and patting the Scarecrow into shape for the poor straw man had been completely flattened out by his fall Well how did you like it called Jellia hurrying over to help the lion untangle himself After the first swoop it wasnt bad at all Really I quite enjoyed it Enjoyed it choked the Lion looking indignantly from Dorothy to Jellia Ill never set foot in a plane again as long as I live Brrrah Ever since we left the Emerald City weve been falling flying and blowing about like yesterdays papers Now that Im on solid ground at last I intend to stay there The rest of you may do as you please but I shall walk home if it takes a year I dont blame you said Jellia patting the lion soothingly on the nose But we cant start without the Wizard Well have to hide here till morning and then try to find him Let him find us growled the Lion lashing his tail experimentally to see whether there was any wag left in it after the shameful way it had been cramped in the suit The whole trip was his idea not mine Oh hush warned Dorothy Someone will hear you Ooooh Someone has And sure enough the faint tinkle of a bell came mysteriously through the gloom Mercy do you suppose those Red Beards have started after us already cried Jellia looking around for the kitbag But how could they have come down the mountain as fast as we fell They couldnt whispered the Scarecrow picking up the bag and handing it to Jellia But dont worry my dears Its probably a herd of goats or cattle These mountaineers ofte
