 a halfgrown person and a ripe one but even those ready to pluck were motionless and silent as if devoid of life This sight explained to Dorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos a thing she had until now been unable to account for Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave their bushes said the Prince You will notice they are all attached to the plants by the soles of their feet and when they are quite ripe they are easily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motion and speech So while they grow they cannot be said to really live and they must be picked before they can become good citizens How long do you live after you are picked asked Dorothy That depends upon the care we take of ourselves he replied If we keep cool and moist and meet with no accidents we often live for five years Ive been picked over six years but our family is known to be especially long lived Do you eat asked the boy Eat No indeed We are quite solid inside our bodies and have no need to eat any more than does a potato But the potatoes sometimes sprout said Zeb And sometimes we do answered the Prince but that is considered a great misfortune for then we must be planted at once Where did you grow asked the Wizard I will show you was the reply Step this way please He led them within another but smaller circle of hedge where grew one large and beautiful bush This said he is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos All of our Princes and Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial They stood before it in silent admiration On the central stalk stood poised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so lovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought she had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life The maidens gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds while dainty lacelike traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves Her flesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory and her poise expressed both dignity and grace Who is this asked the Wizard curiously The Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush Now he answered with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones She is the Ruler destined to be my successor for she is a Royal Princess When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty of the Mangaboos to her Isnt she ripe now asked Dorothy He hesitated Not quite said he finally It will be several days before she needs to be picked or at least that is my judgment I am in no hurry to resign my office and be planted you may be sure Probably not declared the Wizard nodding This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives continued the Prince with a sigh that while we are in our full prime we must give way to another and be covered up in the ground to sprout and grow and give birth to other people Im sure the Princess is ready to be picked asserted Dorothy gazing hard at the beautiful girl on the bush Shes as perfect as she can be Never mind answered the Prince hastily she will be all right for a few days longer and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose of you strangers who have come to our land uninvited and must be attended to at once What are you going to do with us asked Zeb That is a matter I have not quite decided upon was the reply I think I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us But the rest of you must be destroyed in some way and you cannot be planted because I do not wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country You neednt worry said Dorothy We wouldnt grow under ground Im sure But why destroy my friends asked the little Wizard Why not let them live They do not belong here returned the Prince They have no right to be inside the earth at all We didnt ask to come down here we fell said Dorothy That is no excuse declared the Prince coldly The children looked at each other in perplexity and the Wizard sighed Eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft purring voice He wont need to destroy ME for if I dont get something to eat pretty soon I shall starve to death and so save him the trouble If he planted you he might grow some cattails suggested the Wizard Oh Eureka perhaps we can find you some milkweeds to eat said the boy Phoo snarled the kitten I wouldnt touch the nasty things You dont need milk Eureka remarked Dorothy you are big enough now to eat any kind of food If I can get it added Eureka Im hungry myself said Zeb But I noticed some strawberries growing in one of the gardens and some melons in another place These people dont eat such things so perhaps on our way back they will let us get them Never mind your hunger interrupted the Prince I shall order you destroyed in a few minutes so you will have no need to ruin our pretty melon vines and berry bushes Follow me please to meet your doom 5 Dorothy Picks the Princess The words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not
