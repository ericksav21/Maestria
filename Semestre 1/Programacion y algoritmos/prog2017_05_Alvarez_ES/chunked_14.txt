 road said the Stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party I know it returned Dorothy but we have lost the Scarecrow and are wondering how we shall get him again Where is he asked the Stork Over there in the river answered the little girl If he wasnt so big and heavy I would get him for you remarked the Stork He isnt heavy a bit said Dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much Well Ill try said the Stork but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even the Lion and Toto and as they walked along he sang Tolderideoh at every step he felt so gay I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind Stork saved me and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return Thats all right said the Stork who was flying along beside them I always like to help anyone in trouble But I must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you Thank you replied Dorothy and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothys eyes Arent they beautiful the girl asked as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers I suppose so answered the Scarecrow When I have brains I shall probably like them better If I only had a heart I should love them added the Tin Woodman I always did like flowers said the Lion They seem so helpless and frail But there are none in the forest so bright as these They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever But Dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the Scarecrow agreed with him So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep What shall we do asked the Tin Woodman If we leave her here she will die said the Lion The smell of the flowers is killing us all I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already It was true Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers Run fast said the Scarecrow to the Lion and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can We will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go In a moment he was out of sight Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the Scarecrow So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothys lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers On and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end They followed the bend of the river and at last came upon their friend the Lion lying fast asleep among the poppies The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them We can do nothing for him said the Tin Woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift We must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last Im sorry said the Scarecrow The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly But let us go on They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the poppy field t
