t for at one plate the Wizard had put a silver box of metal polish and an emerald bottle containing purest oil Then instead of a chair he had provided a bale of freshly packed straw for the Scarecrow Well well here we all are Rubbing his hands briskly the Wizard beamed on his guests as Fredjon wearing his best suit of green and silver bustled in with the first course And isnt it fun to be here Dorothy took a long satisfying sip of her Ozade Im awfully glad I came back to live in the Land of Oz Arent you Wizard A country where a body grows no older where animals talk as easily as men and where the practice of magic is not only possible but practical a country like that has many advantages admitted the Wizard winking at the Cowardly Lion who was drinking his fruit juice in a refined way from a huge green aquarium I myself never have regretted the years spent in this marvelous fairyland Sometimes I hardly can believe I ever did live in Omaha or travel through the West with a circus I know agreed Dorothy nodding her head slowly Kansas when I think of it seems very far away as much like a dream I suppose as Oz seems like a dream to boys and girls in Kansas who read Oz history Oh why think of Kansas Jellia spoke scornfully In Kansas you were only an ordinary little girl while here you are a Princess and second in importance to our Ruler Ozma herself And in Kansas observed the Scarecrow as Dorothy rather selfconsciously straightened her crown Ill bet you never had as much fun or as many adventures as we have here The Scarecrow being well stuffed with straw never indulged in any refreshments In fact he just came to parties for the conversation and to be sure of a good time he tried to do all the talking himself Thats right said Dorothy thoughtfully that cyclone was about the only thing that ever happened in Kansas A great blow to you my dear but a fortunate thing for Nick and me The Scarecrow patted the Tin Woodman affectionately on the funnel he wore for a hat If you had not blown to Oz Id probably still be hanging on a pole in that cornfield and Nick would be rusting away his life in the greenwood And in some ways mused Dorothy looking dreamily at the model of her small Kansas house in some ways that first adventure always will seem best Just imagine how surprised I was to blow all those miles and find myself in a strange wonderful country like Oz The Munchkins thought I was a sorceress because my house had killed the Wicked Witch of the East Then the Good Witch of the North told me to put on her silver shoes and go to the Emerald City to ask the great OZ to send me home And on the way I discovered you and do you remember how astonished I was when I lifted you down from your pole and found you really were alive and could talk The Scarecrow nodded cheerfully And remember how we traveled on together till we found the Tin Woodman went on Dorothy And Nick told us about the witch who had enchanted his axe so that it chopped off a leg here and an arm there and finally his head and body too And after each accident hed go to a tinsmith who made him new tin arms and legs and finally even a body and a head You didnt mind being Tin at all did you Nick Except that day you went out to chop wood and left your oil can at home Then that storm came up your joints rusted and you couldnt move and there you had been rusting and helpless for months But we hustled back to your hut fetched the oil can and fixed you up in fine shape didnt we old fellow The Scarecrow flung his flimsy arm around Nick Choppers shoulder and the Tin Woodman at the mere mention of rust uncorked the emerald bottle and let three drops of oil slide down his neck I never shall forget your kindness he told them earnestly turning his head first to look at Dorothy and then at the Scarecrow And after that you came along so the Wizard could give you a new heart Dorothy reminded him gaily And right afterwards we met the Cowardly Lion And he was more afraid of us than we were of him teased the Scarecrow leaning across the table to give the lion a poke Yes I was just a big coward in those days admitted the lion blinking approvingly at the rare roast Fredjon had brought him instead of the chicken he was serving the others Just a great big coward Ho hum But not too cowardly to fight for us said Dorothy taking quick little bites of her biscuit and to come with us to the Emerald City Oh that was because I wanted the Wizard to give me some courage roared the lion And werent we surprised when we did reach the Emerald City to find it all built of green marble studded with real emeralds And remember how the Guardian of the Gate gave us all green specs even me and then led us up to the palace You looked awfully funny in those specs laughed Dorothy Ill never forget how funny But remember it was I who carried your messages to Oz put in the Soldier with Green Whiskers Of course it was said Dorothy nodding her head quickly You gave us some splendid advice Soldier and Jellia showed us
