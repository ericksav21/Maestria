so that I might not become lonely There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart She on her part promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her so I set to work harder than ever But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe and when I was chopping away at my best one day for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg This at first seemed a great misfortune for I knew a onelegged man could not do very well as a woodchopper So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin The leg worked very well once I was used to it But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl When I began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg Again I went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted I had them replaced with tin ones The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first I thought that was the end of me But the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then and I worked harder than ever but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that I could move around as well as ever But alas I had now no heart so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl and did not care whether I married her or not I suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me There was only one dangerthat my joints would rust but I kept an oilcan in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it However there came a day when I forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me It was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one If he does I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart All the same said the Scarecrow I shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one I shall take the heart returned the Tin Woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world Dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket To be sure neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed 6 The Cowardly Lion All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods The road was still paved with yellow brick but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good There were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees These sounds made the little girls heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but Toto knew and he walked close to Dorothys side and did not even bark in return How long will it be the child asked of the Tin Woodman before we are out of the forest I cannot tell was the answer for I have never been to the Emerald City But my father went there once when I was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful But I am not afraid so long as I
