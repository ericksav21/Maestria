anger If Ozma sees you before you have time to storm the castle you and your silly flock of flyers are likely to be turned to crows and sparrows The chances are she HAS seen you concluded Nick slanting the Oztober sharply downward At Nicks warning the few clouds flitting across the Airmans forehead became positively thunderous Pouf he sniffed snapping his fingers scornfully Do you suppose a mere girl like this Ohsma of Ohs can frighten me My Blowmen will soon attend to her and anyone else who stands in our way That shouted Nick raising his voice above the roar of the engine remains to be seen As a matter of fact the Oztober and the swarm of flying warriors had been sighted almost as soon as they appeared above the green lands edging the capitol Long before they reached the Emerald City itself terrified messengers had brought word of the approaching airmen Ozma being absent Bettsy and Trot the two little mortal girls who lived with Dorothy and the Supreme Ruler in the Emerald Palace were in charge After one glance at the flying army they had called all the celebrities servants and courtiers together and bade them flee for their lives Then Bettsy Trot and the Patchwork Girl climbed into the Red Wagon With the Saw Horse to pull them they set off at a gallop to hide in the Blue Forests of the Munchkin Country till the invasion was over Tik Tok the Machine Man carrying all of Ozmas loose jewels and valuables marched rapidly after them The Medicine Man rode the Hungry Tiger and the rest of the palace inmates ran helterskelter down the yellow brick highway from the Capitol The inhabitants of the Emerald City itself never having seen the Wizards Ozoplanes and having no way of knowing that Nick Chopper was inside this one were almost as afraid of the Oztober as of the Stratovanians Pelting into their houses and shops they bolted windows and doors and waited in terrorstricken silence for whatever was to come Only the Guardian of the Gate stayed bravely at his post waving his bunch of keys defiantly as the Ozoplane and the Airlanders swooped over the castle wall Ho No you dont cried Strut as Nick having brought the plane to a landing started to run for the door Youll stay with me as a hostage he rasped gripping the Tin Woodmans arm Furious but helpless in the iron grasp of the Stratovanian Nick was forced to lead him into Ozmas beautiful castle Struts warriors after fluttering like curious birds from tree to tree and alighting in chattering groups on the wall finally furled the wings of their staffs formed ranks and marched singing and shouting up the steps after their jubilant leader In vain Nick sought for any signs of weakening among them The Airmen seemed as comfortable and carefree in this lower altitude as they had been on their own airosphere The Tin Woodmans only consolation was that he had brought back the Wizards Ozoplane in as good condition as when it had started away so unexpectedly It was also a great relief to him to find the castle deserted Not a courtier servant or celebrity was in sight C4 not even the Glass Cat or Dorothys little kitten Eureka Strut and his rude army stamped through the first floor from end to end without encountering a single soul Very good sniffed the Ruler of all the Stratovanians shooting his eyes sharply to left and right so this powerful fairy Ohsma of Ohs has run off and left us her castle and we win the war without blowing a blow Ho Ho I shall spend my summers in this enchanting palace he added with a malicious wink at the Tin Woodman But now his grasp on Nicks arm tightened where are these famous magic treasures and jewels you were boasting of this belt and fan and all the other foolishments and fripperies In a safe in Ozmas own apartment Nick told him reluctantly Now that Strut was in complete possession of the castle little was to be gained by concealing the location of the treasures Take me there at once commanded Strut and because the thousand Airlanders were a bit too numerous for comfort Strut ordered them out to the garden bidding them man the walls guard the gates and all entrances and give the alarm should any of the Ozlanders approach Then with lowered head and dragging feet the Tin Woodman led the way to Ozmas private sitting room The safe sparkling with emeralds embedded in metal more valuable than platinum stood in an alcove behind a pair of silk curtains Giving little heed to the elegant appointments of the apartment itself Strut knelt before the safe fairly panting with impatience and curiosity How does it open he asked spinning the little knob on the door round and round without any results whatsoever I am sure I cannot say Resting one elbow on the golden mantel the Tin Woodman looked indifferently at the kneeling Airman Only Ozma and our Wizard ever open that safe Oh is that so Strut straightened up angrily We shall see about that All I have to do is call one of my Blowmen and BLOW it open Suit yourself said Nick with a shrug of his shoulders Only if you do
