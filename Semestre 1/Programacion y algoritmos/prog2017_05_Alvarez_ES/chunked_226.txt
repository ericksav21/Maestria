allowed the whole mass of pretty globes to float into the air and disappear in the far distant sky That is really fine declared Santa Claus who loved toys and pretty things I think Mr Wizard I shall have you blow a bubble around me then I can float away home and see the country spread out beneath me as I travel There isnt a spot on earth that I havent visited but I usually go in the nighttime riding behind my swift reindeer Here is a good chance to observe the country by daylight while I am riding slowly and at my ease Do you think you will be able to guide the bubble asked the Wizard Oh yes I know enough magic to do that replied Santa Claus You blow the bubble with me inside of it and Ill be sure to get home in safety Please send me home in a bubble too begged the Queen of Merryland Very well madam you shall try the journey first politely answered old Santa The pretty wax doll bade goodbye to the Princess Ozma and the others and stood on the platform while the Wizard blew a big soapbubble around her When completed he allowed the bubble to float slowly upward and there could be seen the little Queen of Merryland standing in the middle of it and blowing kisses from her fingers to those below The bubble took a southerly direction quickly floating out of sight Thats a very nice way to travel said Princess Fluff Id like to go home in a bubble too So the Wizard blew a big bubble around Princess Fluff and another around King Bud her brother and a third one around Queen Zixi and soon these three bubbles had mounted into the sky and were floating off in a group in the direction of the kingdom of Noland The success of these ventures induced the other guests from foreign lands to undertake bubble journeys also so the Wizard put them one by one inside his bubbles and Santa Claus directed the way they should go because he knew exactly where everybody lived Finally ButtonBright said I want to go home too Why so you shall cried Santa for Im sure your father and mother will be glad to see you again Mr Wizard please blow a big fine bubble for ButtonBright to ride in and Ill agree to send him home to his family as safe as safe can be Im sorry said Dorothy with a sigh for she was fond of her little comrade but praps its best for ButtonBright to get home cause his folks must be worrying just dreadful She kissed the boy and Ozma kissed him too and all the others waved their hands and said goodbye and wished him a pleasant journey Are you glad to leave us dear asked Dorothy a little wistfully Dont know said ButtonBright He sat down crosslegged on the platform with his sailor hat tipped back on his head and the Wizard blew a beautiful bubble all around him A minute later it had mounted into the sky sailing toward the west and the last they saw of ButtonBright he was still sitting in the middle of the shining globe and waving his sailor hat at those below Will you ride in a bubble or shall I send you and Toto home by means of the Magic Belt the Princess asked Dorothy Guess Ill use the Belt replied the little girl Im sort of fraid of those bubbles Bowwow said Toto approvingly He loved to bark at the bubbles as they sailed away but he didnt care to ride in one Santa Claus decided to go next He thanked Ozma for her hospitality and wished her many happy returns of the day Then the Wizard blew a bubble around his chubby little body and smaller bubbles around each of his Ryls and Knooks As the kind and generous friend of children mounted into the air the people all cheered at the top of their voices for they loved Santa Claus dearly and the little man heard them through the walls of his bubble and waved his hands in return as he smiled down upon them The band played bravely while every one watched the bubble until it was completely out of sight How bout you Polly Dorothy asked her friend Are you fraid of bubbles too No answered Polychrome smiling but Santa Claus promised to speak to my father as he passed through the sky So perhaps I shall get home an easier way Indeed the little maid had scarcely made this speech when a sudden radiance filled the air and while the people looked on in wonder the end of a gorgeous rainbow slowly settled down upon the platform With a glad cry the Rainbows Daughter sprang from her seat and danced along the curve of the bow mounting gradually upward while the folds of her gauzy gown whirled and floated around her like a cloud and blended with the colors of the rainbow itself Goodbye Ozma Goodbye Dorothy cried a voice they knew belonged to Polychrome but now the little maidens form had melted wholly into the rainbow and their eyes could no longer see her Suddenly the end of the rainbow lifted and its colors slowly faded like mist before a breeze Dorothy sighed deeply and turned to Ozma Im sorry to lose Polly she said but I guess shes better off with her father cause even the Land of Oz couldnt be like home to a cloud fairy No indeed replied the Princess but it has been delightful for us to know Polychrome f
