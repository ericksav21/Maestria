d Prince Evring holding it out upon his hand It was in the shape of a little fat pig made of tin and painted green The whistle was in the tail of the pig Where did you get it asked the yellow hen closely examining the toy with her bright eyes Why I picked it up in the Nome Kings palace while Dorothy was making her guesses and I put it in my pocket answered the little Prince Billina laughed or at least she made the peculiar cackle that served her for a laugh No wonder I couldnt find the Tin Woodman she said and no wonder the magic belt didnt make him appear or the King couldnt find him either What do you mean questioned Dorothy Why the Prince had him in his pocket cried Billina cackling again I did not protested little Evring I only took the whistle Well then watch me returned the hen and reaching out a claw she touched the whistle and said Ev Swish Good afternoon said the Tin Woodman taking off his funnel cap and bowing to Dorothy and the Prince I think I must have been asleep for the first time since I was made of tin for I do not remember our leaving the Nome King You have been enchanted answered the girl throwing an arm around her old friend and hugging him tight in her joy But its all right now I want my whistle said the little Prince beginning to cry Hush cautioned Billina The whistle is lost but you may have another when you get home The Scarecrow had fairly thrown himself upon the bosom of his old comrade so surprised and delighted was he to see him again and Tiktok squeezed the Tin Woodmans hand so earnestly that he dented some of his fingers Then they had to make way for Ozma to welcome the tin man and the army caught sight of him and set up a cheer and everybody was delighted and happy For the Tin Woodman was a great favorite with all who knew him and his sudden recovery after they had thought he was lost to them forever was indeed a pleasant surprise Before long the cavalcade arrived at the royal palace where a great crowd of people had gathered to welcome their Queen and her ten children There was much shouting and cheering and the people threw flowers in their path and every face wore a happy smile They found the Princess Langwidere in her mirrored chamber where she was admiring one of her handsomest headsone with rich chestnut hair dreamy walnut eyes and a shapely hickorynut nose She was very glad to be relieved of her duties to the people of Ev and the Queen graciously permitted her to retain her rooms and her cabinet of heads as long as she lived Then the Queen took her eldest son out upon a balcony that overlooked the crowd of subjects gathered below and said to them Here is your future ruler King Evardo Fifteenth He is fifteen years of age has fifteen silver buckles on his jacket and is the fifteenth Evardo to rule the land of Ev The people shouted their approval fifteen times and even the Wheelers some of whom were present loudly promised to obey the new King So the Queen placed a big crown of gold set with rubies upon Evardos head and threw an ermine robe over his shoulders and proclaimed him King and he bowed gratefully to all his subjects and then went away to see if he could find any cake in the royal pantry Ozma of Oz and her people as well as Dorothy Tiktok and Billina were splendidly entertained by the Queen mother who owed all her happiness to their kind offices and that evening the yellow hen was publicly presented with a beautiful necklace of pearls and sapphires as a token of esteem from the new King 20 The Emerald City Dorothy decided to accept Ozmas invitation to return with her to the Land of Oz There was no greater chance of her getting home from Ev than from Oz and the little girl was anxious to see once more the country where she had encountered such wonderful adventures By this time Uncle Henry would have reached Australia in his ship and had probably given her up for lost so he couldnt worry any more than he did if she stayed away from him a while longer So she would go to Oz They bade goodbye to the people of Ev and the King promised Ozma that he would ever be grateful to her and render the Land of Oz any service that might lie within his power And then they approached the edge of the dangerous desert and Ozma threw down the magic carpet which at once unrolled far enough for all of them to walk upon it without being crowded Tiktok claiming to be Dorothys faithful follower because he belonged to her had been permitted to join the party and before they started the girl wound up his machinery as far as possible and the copper man stepped off as briskly as any one of them Ozma also invited Billina to visit the Land of Oz and the yellow hen was glad enough to go where new sights and scenes awaited her They began the trip across the desert early in the morning and as they stopped only long enough for Billina to lay her daily egg before sunset they espied the green slopes and wooded hills of the beautiful Land of Oz They entered it in the Munchkin territory and the King of th
