 case Roger does manage to catch one of those flying fish Kobo was staring fixedly at her vegetable vine as Tandy dropped down beside her and now snapping off a whole bushel of beans she turned round and munching contentedly surveyed the excited boy at her side Whatever you have can be hung to my harness she assured him speaking a bit thickly through the beans But turn the point of that scimitar up instead of down You wouldnt want to carve old Kobo now would you It will seem funny swimming through a forest wont it little King The further we go on this voyage the queerer everything grows But I like it queer stated Tandy climbing with a satisfied little sigh on Nikobos broad back I too find it most interesting and jolly agreed the hippopotamus fastening her eyes dreamily on the vegetable vine to see what was coming on next I thought I might be on short rations when I came on this voyage Tandy but I declare to goodness Ive never had such a rich and varied diet in my life You too look fine and strong and much happier than when we met in the jungle But to get back to the fareFF20C4 why today Ive had a basket of biscuits a bushel of beansFF20C4 And that makes it Bean and Biscuit Day I suppose giggled Tandy remembering Kobos strange way of dividing up her week But look Listen Here they come Ahoy below Hip Hip OPOTOMUS AHOY roared Samuel Salt jovially from above All ready to cast off my lass Aye aye sir grinned Kobo as Samuel and Ato came panting down the rope ladders to the raft Move over Tandy and make room for the Cook and the Captain It took nearly ten minutes to get all the gear and crew aboard and Nikobo looked like some curious deepsea monster when she finally shoved off Two large baskets were slung from ropes across her back The pail and bird cage slapped up and down on one hip the aquarium on the other and through her collar various fishing rods nets and poles were stuck like quills on a porcupine Now whatever you do dont submerge warned Samuel holding his tin box for especially fragile specimens high above his chest to keep it dry Just slow and steady mlass so well have time to observe and admire and make notes of any strange growths and creatures as we ride along Creatures exclaimed Tandy twisting round He was perched on Nikobos head his paints held carefully in his lap Would there be any wild animals in a sea forest Master Salt Sea Lions likely predicted Samuel peering round eagerly as Nikobo paddled between two slipperybarked sea trees into the murmuring forest itself Except for the fact that the floor of this curious sea wood was the blue and restless sea it might almost have been a forest ashore The trees tall straight and stately towered up toward the sky Staring down into the clear green water Tandy saw their trunks going down down down as far as he could see Rooted in the very ocean bed marveled Samuel Salt touching one lovingly as they passed What splendid masts these would make Mates Avast and belay Nikobo I believe Ill just take a cutting or two Ha ha roared Ato peering over Samuels shoulder So now were going to grow our own masts Samuel himself leaning far out over Nikobos back severed three young shoots from the sea tree and popped them happily into the aquarium Vines that were really of coral ringed the gigantic trunks like bracelets and the leaves of the trees were long ribbons of green and silver that whipped and fluttered like banners in the morning breeze Whats that puzzled Ato as the hippopotamus made her way leisurely between the trees Looks like mushrooms Sammy Wait Ill just pick me a few and see Hooking his heels in Nikobos harness Ato began vigorously cutting from the trunk of one of the trees the colored fungus growths which sprouted in great profusion just above the water line Nikobo bravely offered to sample some and after waiting anxiously to see whether they would have any ill effects the ships cook decided they were harmless and joyfully filled one of the baskets The only specimens that really interested Ato were of the edible variety While he was thus employed Tandy an experienced climber by now scurried up to the top of one of the sea trees breaking off several branches so Samuel could press the curious leaves in his album High above his head Tandy could see Roger chasing angrily after a flying fish muttering with anger at his unsuccessful efforts to overtake the nimble little sea bird In our own southern waters there are large flying fish that leap out of the water of the gulf stream but the flying fish in this Nonestic Sea Forest were small and where most fish have gills wore strong transparent wings Their claws somewhat like a crabs made it possible for them to perch jauntily in the branches of the sea trees and these strange little fellows could swim and dive as well as fly Pulling out his pad Tandy made a lively sketch of one in the tree opposite for it did look as if Roger would never succeed in catching one All morning Nikobo paddled calmly through the dreamy sea fore
