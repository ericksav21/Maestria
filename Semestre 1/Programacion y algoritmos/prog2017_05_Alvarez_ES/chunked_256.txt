led the wicked witch who ruled the Winkies And did you asked Pigasus rolling over and looking up at Dorothy with real admiration Well that was sort of an accident too admitted the little girl honestly When the Tin Woodman the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion and I reached the witchs yellow castle the witch captured us all and made me work hard from morning till night But one day Dorothy with an anxious eye on the door hurriedly continued one day when she tried to steal my silver shoes I got SO mad I picked up a bucket of water Id been using for scrubbing and flung it right over her head And did that destroy her Pigasus demanded incredulously Yes said Dorothy it melted her down to nothing at all But what about the star I never noticed that before Thats where the Good Witch of the North comes in answered Dorothy proudly Right after my house fell on the Wicked Witch of the West she appeared and when she discovered I was a mortal she kissed me on the forehead to keep me from harm all the time I was in Oz It only shows now because Im black I suppose Well why didnt it keep you from turning black if its so wonderful Pigasus switched his curly tail resentfully I dont know Dorothy looked thoughtfully around Glomas strange laboratory Maybe the spell has worn off maybe theres no harm in being black Humph There may not be any harm in it but its pretty sad and mournful if you ask me grunted Pigasus glaring savagely at his satiny black sides I prefer myself pink and you pink and white the way you were Tea and turnips first thing I know youll be powdering your nose with ashes and soot But after allFF20C4 Pigasus swung himself energetically to his feet C4FF20that is the least of our troubles What do you suppose this witch will do to us now And what can we do to her Sahay Spreading his wings Pigasus spun round in a triumphant circle All we have to do is to find some water Why its simple as soup Quick Dorothy look and see whether there is any water around here then as soon as Gloma pops her nose in the door well put her out as neatly as you did that other witch But those other witches were bad and Gloma seems really good and beautiful objected Dorothy looking around without much enthusiasm Beautiful or not shes a dark and dangerous lady insisted the pig beginning his search in a methodical way and its her beauty or ours remember this Black Queen is quite determined to destroy us if we dont destroy her first Yes I suppose so agreed Dorothy Slowly following Pigasus she pulled aside black velvet curtains peered behind cupboards and screens and looked under sofas and chairs There were many ebony cabinets standing against the wall but each one was securely locked and except for a great black crystal ball on a table in the center of the room there seemed to be no magic apparatus at all A dark lantern swinging from the domed ceiling cast its curious luminous black rays into every corner of the witchs laboratory After circling the room three times Pigasus and Dorothy were forced to admit there was no water of any kind or even a pail available Well have to think of something else grumbled the pig as Dorothy again sat down on her stool Are you thinking he demanded sharply as the little girl stared absently at the tips of her boots No confessed Dorothy frankly I was just wondering why Gloma calls this a darkroom She must know since General Blotz ducked us under the Black River we can see in here as well as in the forest I wouldnt be too sure of that muttered the pig coming over and crowding as close to Dorothy as he could It almost seemed as if someone had heard him for scarcely were the words out of his mouth before the dark lantern over their heads sputtered ominously and went out leaving them in a perfectly pitchblack darkness IC4 IC4 I felt something like this would happen faltered Pigasus throwing his left wing protectingly around Dorothy Listen Someone is coming A light sure footstep sounded in the passage came closer then a sudden puff of air told them that someone had opened the door Remember Piggins dear no matter what happens we must be brave whispered Dorothy trembling a little in spite of herself Its hard to be brave in the dark but Ill do my best Here lean on me And though the happenings of the next ten minutes were enough to try the courage of a dozen lions Pigasus kept his word and never uttered a sound As the two prisoners clung desperately together the crystal on the center table received a sudden shattering blow Up spurted a perfect fountain of fire coming down over Dorothy and Pigasus in a shower of redhot sparks But the sparks fell harmlessly as raindrops on the winged pig and the little girl and after a great hiss and sputter went out leaving the laboratory in darkness again Scarcely had they recovered from this shock before a second blow was struck and this time a hundred huge hideous black snakes came writhing out of the crystal their green glittering eyes lighting up the room with a terrifying sulphurous light Th
