atch out and see that no one comes near to disturb us Then the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the Pumpkinhead and being greatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep LineArt Drawing 58 Full page lineart drawing 59 Jack Pumpkinheads Ride to the Emerald City At daybreak Tip was awakened by the Pumpkinhead He rubbed the sleep from his eyes bathed in a little brook and then ate a portion of his bread and cheese Having thus prepared for a new day the boy said Let us start at once Nine miles is quite a distance but we ought to reach the Emerald City by noon if no accidents happen So the Pumpkinhead was again perched upon the back of the SawHorse and the journey was resumed Tip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded to a dull lavender and before long this lavender appeared to take on a greenish tinge that gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the great City where the Scarecrow ruled 60 The little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when the road of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river Tip was puzzled how to cross over but after a time he discovered a man in a ferryboat approaching from the other side of the stream When the man reached the bank Tip asked Will you row us to the other side Yes if you have money returned the ferryman whose face looked cross and disagreeable But I have no money said Tip None at all inquired the man None at all answered the boy Then Ill not break my back rowing you over said the ferryman decidedly What a nice man remarked the Pumpkinhead smilingly The ferryman stared at him but made no reply Tip was trying to think for it was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought to an end I must certainly get to the Emerald City he said to the boatman but how can I cross the river if you do not take me The man laughed and it was not a nice laugh That wooden horse will float said he and 61 LineArt Drawing you can ride him across As for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you let him sink or swim it wont matter greatly which Dont worry about me said Jack smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed ferryman Im sure I ought to float beautifully Tip thought the experiment was worth making and the SawHorse who did not know what danger meant offered no objections whatever So the boy led it down into the water and climbed upon its back Jack also waded in up to his knees and 62 grasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above the water Now said Tip instructing the SawHorse if you wiggle your legs you will probably swim and if you swim we shall probably reach the other side The SawHorse at once began to wiggle its legs which acted as oars and moved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side So successful was the trip that presently they were climbing wet and dripping up the grassy bank Tips trouserlegs and shoes were thoroughly soaked but the SawHorse had floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry As for the Pumpkinhead every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water The sun will soon dry us said Tip and anyhow we are now safely across in spite of the ferryman and can continue our journey I didnt mind swimming at all remarked the horse Nor did I added Jack They soon regained the road of yellow brick which proved to be a continuation of the road they had left on the other side and then Tip once more mounted the Pumpkinhead upon the back of the SawHorse 63 If you ride fast said he the wind will help to dry your clothing I will hold on to the horses tail and run after you In this way we all will become dry in a very short time Then the horse must step lively said Jack Ill do my best returned the SawHorse cheerfully Tip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the SawHorse and called loudly Getup The horse started at a good pace and Tip followed behind Then he decided they could go faster so he shouted Trot Now the SawHorse remembered that this word was the command to go as fast as he could so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous pace LineArt Drawing 64 and Tip had hard workrunning faster than he ever had before in his lifeto keep his feet Soon he was out of breath and although he wanted to call Whoa to the horse he found he could not get the word out of his throat Then the end of the tail he was clutching being nothing more than a dead branch suddenly broke away and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road while the horse and its pumpkinheaded rider dashed on and quickly disappeared in the distance By the time Tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat so he could say Whoa there was no further need of saying it for the horse was long since out of sight So he did the only sensible thing he could do He sat down and took a good rest and afterward began walking along the road Some time I will surely overtake them he reflected for the road will end at the gates of the Emerald
