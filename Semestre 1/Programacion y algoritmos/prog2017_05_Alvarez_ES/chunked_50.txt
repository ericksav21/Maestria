 And who is Dorothy She was a girl that came here from Kansas a place in the big outside World She got blown to the Land of Oz by a cyclone and while she was here the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman accompanied her on her travels And where is she now inquired the Pumpkinhead Glinda the Good who rules the Quadlings sent her home again said the boy Oh And what became of the Scarecrow I told you He rules the Emerald City answered Tip I thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful Wizard objected Jack seeming more and more confused Well so I did Now pay attention and Ill explain it said Tip speaking slowly and looking the smiling Pumpkinhead squarely in the eye Dorothy went to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard to send her back to Kansas and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman went with her But the Wizard couldnt send her back because he wasnt so much of a Wizard as he might have been And then they got angry at the Wizard and threatened 37 to expose him so the Wizard made a big balloon and escaped in it and no one has ever seen him since Now that is very interesting history said Jack well pleased and I understand it perfectly all but the explanation Im glad you do responded Tip After the Wizard was gone the people of the Emerald City made His Majesty the Scarecrow their King and I have heard that he became a very popular ruler Are we going to see this queer King asked Jack with interest I think we may as well replied the boy unless you have something better to do Oh no dear father said the Pumpkinhead I am quite willing to go wherever you please LineArt Drawing 38 Full page lineart drawing 39 Tip Makes an Experiment in Magic The boy small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat embarrassed at being called father by the tall awkward pumpkinheaded man but to deny the relationship would involve another long and tedious explanation so he changed the subject by asking abruptly Are you tired Of course not replied the other But he continued after a pause it is quite certain I shall wear out my wooden joints if I keep on walking Tip reflected as they journeyed on that this was true He began to regret that he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and substantially Yet how could he ever have guessed 40 that the man he had made merely to scare old Mombi with would be brought to life by means of a magical powder contained in an old pepperbox So he ceased to reproach himself and began to think how he might yet remedy the deficiencies of Jacks weak joints While thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood and the boy sat down to rest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there Why dont you sit down he asked the Pumpkinhead Wont it strain my joints inquired the other Of course not Itll rest them declared the boy So Jack tried to sit down but as soon as he bent his joints farther than usual they gave way altogether and he came clattering to the ground with such a crash that Tip feared he was entirely ruined LineArt Drawing along right side of this page 41 He rushed to the man lifted him to his feet straightened his arms and legs and felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked But Jack seemed to be in pretty good shape after all and Tip said to him I guess youd better remain standing hereafter It seems the safest way Very well dear father just as you say replied the smiling Jack who had been in no wise confused by his tumble Tip sat down again Presently the Pumpkinhead asked What is that thing you are sitting on Oh this is a horse replied the boy carelessly What is a horse demanded Jack A horse Why there are two kinds of horses returned Tip slightly puzzled how to explain One kind of horse is alive and has four legs and a head and a tail And people ride upon its back I understand said Jack cheerfully Thats the kind of horse you are now sitting on No it isnt answered Tip promptly Why not That one has four legs and a head and a tail Tip looked at the sawhorse more carefully and found that the Pumpkinhead was right The body 42 had been formed from a treetrunk and a branch had been left sticking up at one end that looked very much like a tail In the other end were two big knots that resembled eyes and a place had been chopped away that might easily be mistaken for the horses mouth As for the legs they were four straight limbs cut from trees and stuck fast into the body being spread wide apart so that the sawhorse would stand firmly when a log was laid across it to be sawed This thing resembles a real horse more than I imagined said Tip trying to explain But a real horse is alive and trots and prances and eats oats while this is nothing more than a dead horse made of wood and used to saw logs upon If it were alive wouldnt it trot and prance and eat oats inquired the Pumpkinhead It would trot and prance perhaps but it wouldnt eat oats replied the boy laughing at the idea And of course it cant ever be alive because it is made of wood So am I answered the man Tip looked at him in surprise
