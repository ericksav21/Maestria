 guests in the drawingroom with a feeling of certainty that she would surprise them with her beauty However she was greatly disappointed to find that her visitors were merely a small girl in a gingham dress a copper man that would only go when wound up and a yellow hen that was sitting contentedly in Langwideres best workbasket where there was a china egg used for darning stockings It may surprise you to learn that a princess ever does such a common thing as darn stockings But if you will stop to think you will realize that a princess is sure to wear holes in her stockings the same as other people only it isnt considered quite polite to mention the matter Oh said Langwidere slightly lifting the nose of No 17 I thought some one of importance had called Then you were right declared Dorothy Im a good deal of portance myself and when Billina lays an egg she has the proudest cackle you ever heard As for Tiktok hes the StopStop commanded the Princess with an angry flash of her splendid eyes How dare you annoy me with your senseless chatter Why you horrid thing said Dorothy who was not accustomed to being treated so rudely The Princess looked at her more closely Tell me she resumed are you of royal blood Better than that maam said Dorothy I came from Kansas Huh cried the Princess scornfully You are a foolish child and I cannot allow you to annoy me Run away you little goose and bother some one else Dorothy was so indignant that for a moment she could find no words to reply But she rose from her chair and was about to leave the room when the Princess who had been scanning the girls face stopped her by saying more gently Come nearer to me Dorothy obeyed without a thought of fear and stood before the Princess while Langwidere examined her face with careful attention You are rather attractive said the lady presently Not at all beautiful you understand but you have a certain style of prettiness that is different from that of any of my thirty heads So I believe Ill take your head and give you No 26 for it Well I blieve you wont exclaimed Dorothy It will do you no good to refuse continued the Princess for I need your head for my collection and in the Land of Ev my will is law I never have cared much for No 26 and you will find that it is very little worn Besides it will do you just as well as the one youre wearing for all practical purposes I dont know anything about your No 26 and I dont want to said Dorothy firmly Im not used to taking castoff things so Ill just keep my own head You refuse cried the Princess with a frown Of course I do was the reply Then said Langwidere I shall lock you up in a tower until you decide to obey me Nanda turning to her maid call my army Nanda rang a silver bell and at once a big fat colonel in a bright red uniform entered the room followed by ten lean soldiers who all looked sad and discouraged and saluted the princess in a very melancholy fashion Carry that girl to the North Tower and lock her up cried the Princess pointing to Dorothy To hear is to obey answered the big red colonel and caught the child by her arm But at that moment Tiktok raised his dinnerpail and pounded it so forcibly against the colonels head that the big officer sat down upon the floor with a sudden bump looking both dazed and very much astonished Help he shouted and the ten lean soldiers sprang to assist their leader There was great excitement for the next few moments and Tiktok had knocked down seven of the army who were sprawling in every direction upon the carpet when suddenly the machine paused with the dinnerpail raised for another blow and remained perfectly motionless My action has run down he called to Dorothy Wind me up quick She tried to obey but the big colonel had by this time managed to get upon his feet again so he grabbed fast hold of the girl and she was helpless to escape This is too bad said the machine I ought to have run six hours longer at least but I suppose my long walk and my fight with the Wheelers made me run down faster than usual Well it cant be helped said Dorothy with a sigh Will you exchange heads with me demanded the Princess No indeed cried Dorothy Then lock her up said Langwidere to her soldiers and they led Dorothy to a high tower at the north of the palace and locked her securely within The soldiers afterward tried to lift Tiktok but they found the machine so solid and heavy that they could not stir it So they left him standing in the center of the drawingroom People will think I have a new statue said Langwidere so it wont matter in the least and Nanda can keep him well polished What shall we do with the hen asked the colonel who had just discovered Billina in the workbasket Put her in the chickenhouse answered the Princess Someday Ill have her fried for breakfast She looks rather tough Your Highness said Nanda doubtfully That is a base slander cried Billina struggling frantically in the colonels arms But the breed of chickens I come from is said to be poison to all princesses The
