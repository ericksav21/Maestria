ssion Dorothy was a general favorite and she walked arm in arm with the Scarecrow who was beloved by all Then came Polychrome and ButtonBright and the people loved the Rainbows pretty Daughter and the beautiful blueeyed boy as soon as they saw them The shaggy man in his shaggy new suit attracted much attention because he was such a novelty With regular steps tramped the machineman Tiktok and there was more cheering when the Wizard of Oz followed in the procession The WoggleBug and Jack Pumpkinhead were next and behind them Glinda the Sorceress and the Good Witch of the North Finally came Billina with her brood of chickens to whom she clucked anxiously to keep them together and to hasten them along so they would not delay the procession Another band followed this time the Tin Band of the Emperor of the Winkies playing a beautiful march called Theres No Plate Like Tin Then came the servants of the Royal Palace in a long line and behind them all the people joined the procession and marched away through the emerald gates and out upon the broad green Here had been erected a splendid pavilion with a grandstand big enough to seat all the royal party and those who had taken part in the procession Over the pavilion which was of green silk and cloth of gold countless banners waved in the breeze Just in front of this and connected with it by a runway had been built a broad platform so that all the spectators could see plainly the entertainment provided for them The Wizard now became Master of Ceremonies as Ozma had placed the conduct of the performance in his hands After the people had all congregated about the platform and the royal party and the visitors were seated in the grandstand the Wizard skillfully performed some feats of juggling glass balls and lighted candles He tossed a dozen or so of them high in the air and caught them one by one as they came down without missing any Then he introduced the Scarecrow who did a swordswallowing act that aroused much interest After this the Tin Woodman gave an exhibition of Swinging the Axe which he made to whirl around him so rapidly that the eye could scarcely follow the motion of the gleaming blade Glinda the Sorceress then stepped upon the platform and by her magic made a big tree grow in the middle of the space made blossoms appear upon the tree and made the blossoms become delicious fruit called tamornas and so great was the quantity of fruit produced that when the servants climbed the tree and tossed it down to the crowd there was enough to satisfy every person present Para Bruin the rubber bear climbed to a limb of the big tree rolled himself into a ball and dropped to the platform whence he bounded up again to the limb He repeated this bouncing act several times to the great delight of all the children present After he had finished and bowed and returned to his seat Glinda waved her wand and the tree disappeared but its fruit still remained to be eaten The Good Witch of the North amused the people by transforming ten stones into ten birds the ten birds into ten lambs and the ten lambs into ten little girls who gave a pretty dance and were then transformed into ten stones again just as they were in the beginning Johnny Dooit next came on the platform with his toolchest and in a few minutes built a great flying machine then put his chest in the machine and the whole thing flew away togetherJohnny and allafter he had bid goodbye to those present and thanked the Princess for her hospitality The Wizard then announced the last act of all which was considered really wonderful He had invented a machine to blow huge soapbubbles as big as balloons and this machine was hidden under the platform so that only the rim of the big clay pipe to produce the bubbles showed above the flooring The tank of soapsuds and the airpumps to inflate the bubbles were out of sight beneath so that when the bubbles began to grow upon the floor of the platform it really seemed like magic to the people of Oz who knew nothing about even the common soapbubbles that our children blow with a penny clay pipe and a basin of soapandwater The Wizard had invented another thing Usually soapbubbles are frail and burst easily lasting only a few moments as they float in the air but the Wizard added a sort of glue to his soapsuds which made his bubbles tough and as the glue dried rapidly when exposed to the air the Wizards bubbles were strong enough to float for hours without breaking He began by blowingby means of his machinery and airpumpsseveral large bubbles which he allowed to float upward into the sky where the sunshine fell upon them and gave them iridescent hues that were most beautiful This aroused much wonder and delight because it was a new amusement to every one presentexcept perhaps Dorothy and ButtonBright and even they had never seen such big strong bubbles before The Wizard then blew a bunch of small bubbles and afterward blew a big bubble around them so they were left in the center of it then he
