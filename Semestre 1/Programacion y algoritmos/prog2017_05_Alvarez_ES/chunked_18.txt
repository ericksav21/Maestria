olish errand nor an idle one replied the Scarecrow it is important And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard So he is said the green man and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well But to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face I am the Guardian of the Gates and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his Palace But first you must put on the spectacles Why asked Dorothy Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day They are all locked on for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built and I have the only key that will unlock them He opened the big box and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape All of them had green glasses in them The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck When they were on Dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City so she said nothing Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion and even on little Toto and all were locked fast with the key Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City 11 The Wonderful City of Oz Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds They walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and glittering in the brightness of the sun The window panes were of green glass even the sky above the City had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green There were many peoplemen women and childrenwalking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion but no one spoke to them Many shops stood in the street and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes of all sorts At one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the City which was the Palace of Oz the Great Wizard There was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard Here are strangers said the Guardian of the Gates to him and they demand to see the Great Oz Step inside answered the soldier and I will carry your message to him So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and when they were seated he said politely Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned When at last he came back Dorothy asked Have you seen Oz Oh no returned the soldier I have never seen him But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message He said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day Therefore as you must remain in the Palace for several days I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey Thank you replied the girl that is very kind of Oz The soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room She had lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said Follow me and I will show you your room So Dorothy said goodbye to all her friends except Toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace
