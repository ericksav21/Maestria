t their glittering eyes and contrasting colors and removable heads that inspired the poor prisoners with horror and made them long to escape But the creatures led their captives away from the rocks and the road down the hill by a side path until they came before a low mountain of rock that looked like a huge bowl turned upside down At the edge of this mountain was a deep gulfso deep that when you looked into it there was nothing but blackness below Across the gulf was a narrow bridge of rock and at the other end of the bridge was an arched opening that led into the mountain Over this bridge the Scoodlers led their prisoners through the opening into the mountain which they found to be an immense hollow dome lighted by several holes in the roof All around the circular space were built rock houses set close together each with a door in the front wall None of these houses was more than six feet wide but the Scoodlers were thin people sidewise and did not need much room So vast was the dome that there was a large space in the middle of the cave in front of all these houses where the creatures might congregate as in a great hall It made Dorothy shudder to see a huge iron kettle suspended by a stout chain in the middle of the place and underneath the kettle a great heap of kindling wood and shavings ready to light Whats that asked the shaggy man drawing back as they approached this place so that they were forced to push him forward The Soup Kettle yelled the Scoodlers and then they shouted in the next breath Were hungry ButtonBright holding Dorothys hand in one chubby fist and Pollys hand in the other was so affected by this shout that he began to cry again repeating the protest Dont want to be soup I dont Never mind said the shaggy man consolingly I ought to make enough soup to feed them all Im so big so Ill ask them to put me in the kettle first All right said ButtonBright more cheerfully But the Scoodlers were not ready to make soup yet They led the captives into a house at the farthest side of the cavea house somewhat wider than the others Who lives here asked the Rainbows Daughter The Scoodlers nearest her replied The Queen It made Dorothy hopeful to learn that a woman ruled over these fierce creatures but a moment later they were ushered by two or three of the escort into a gloomy bare roomand her hope died away For the Queen of the Scoodlers proved to be much more dreadful in appearance than any of her people One side of her was fiery red with jetblack hair and green eyes and the other side of her was bright yellow with crimson hair and black eyes She wore a short skirt of red and yellow and her hair instead of being banged was a tangle of short curls upon which rested a circular crown of silvermuch dented and twisted because the Queen had thrown her head at so many things so many times Her form was lean and bony and both her faces were deeply wrinkled What have we here asked the Queen sharply as our friends were made to stand before her Soup cried the guard of Scoodlers speaking together Were not said Dorothy indignantly were nothing of the sort Ah but you will be soon retorted the Queen a grim smile making her look more dreadful than before Pardon me most beautiful vision said the shaggy man bowing before the queen politely I must request your Serene Highness to let us go our way without being made into soup For I own the Love Magnet and whoever meets me must love me and all my friends True replied the Queen We love you very much so much that we intend to eat your broth with real pleasure But tell me do you think I am so beautiful You wont be at all beautiful if you eat me he said shaking his head sadly Handsome is as handsome does you know The Queen turned to ButtonBright Do YOU think Im beautiful she asked No said the boy youre ugly I think youre a fright said Dorothy If you could see yourself youd be terribly scared added Polly The Queen scowled at them and flopped from her red side to her yellow side Take them away she commanded the guard and at six oclock run them through the meat chopper and start the soup kettle boiling And put plenty of salt in the broth this time or Ill punish the cooks severely Any onions your Majesty asked one of the guard Plenty of onions and garlic and a dash of red pepper Now go The Scoodlers led the captives away and shut them up in one of the houses leaving only a single Scoodler to keep guard The place was a sort of storehouse containing bags of potatoes and baskets of carrots onions and turnips These said their guard pointing to the vegetables we use to flavor our soups with The prisoners were rather disheartened by this time for they saw no way to escape and did not know how soon it would be six oclock and time for the meatchopper to begin work But the shaggy man was brave and did not intend to submit to such a horrid fate without a struggle Im going to fight for our lives he whispered to the children for if I fail we will be no worse off than before and to sit here qui
