of them was shocked by the dreadful report more than once for the main band kept far away and each time a new company was sent into the battle When the Wizard had fired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy except to stun a few by the noise and so be as no nearer to victory than in the beginning of the fray What shall we do now asked Dorothy anxiously Lets yellall together said Zeb And fight at the same time added the Wizard We will get near Jim so that he can help us and each one must take some weapon and do the best he can Ill use my sword although it isnt much account in this affair Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when the wooden folks attack her I havent anything for you Zeb Ill use the king said the boy and pulled his prisoner out of the buggy The bound Gargoyles arms extended far out beyond its head so by grasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club The boy was strong for one of his years having always worked upon a farm so he was likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard When the next company of Gargoyles advanced our adventurers began yelling as if they had gone mad Even the kitten gave a dreadfully shrill scream and at the same time Jim the cabhorse neighed loudly This daunted the enemy for a time but the defenders were soon out of breath Perceiving this as well as the fact that there were no more of the awful bangs to come from the revolvers the Gargoyles advanced in a swarm as thick as bees so that the air was filled with them Dorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol which nearly covered her and proved a great protection The Wizards swordblade snapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against the wooden people Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a club until he had knocked down dozens of foes but at the last they clustered so thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing his arms The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eureka assisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bit at them like a wildcat But all this bravery amounted to nothing at all The wooden things wound their long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast Dorothy was captured in the same way and numbers of the Gargoyles clung to Jims legs so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless Eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the ground like a streak but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed her before she had gone very far All of them expected nothing less than instant death but to their surprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore them far away over miles and miles of wooden country until they came to a wooden city The houses of this city had many corners being square and sixsided and eightsided They were towerlike in shape and the best of them seemed old and weatherworn yet all were strong and substantial To one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows but only one broad opening far up underneath the roof the prisoners were brought by their captors The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening where there was a platform and then flew away and left them As they had no wings the strangers could not fly away and if they jumped down from such a height they would surely be killed The creatures had sense enough to reason that way and the only mistake they made was in supposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinary difficulties Jim was brought with the others although it took a good many Gargoyles to carry the big beast through the air and land him on the high platform and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged to the party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for or whether it was alive or not When Eurekas captor had thrown the kitten after the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared leaving our friends to breathe freely once more What an awful fight said Dorothy catching her breath in little gasps Oh I dont know purred Eureka smoothing her ruffled fur with her paw we didnt manage to hurt anybody and nobody managed to hurt us Thank goodness we are together again even if we are prisoners sighed the little girl I wonder why they didnt kill us on the spot remarked Zeb who had lost his king in the struggle They are probably keeping us for some ceremony the Wizard answered reflectively but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead as possible in a short time As dead as possble would be pretty dead wouldnt it asked Dorothy Yes my dear But we have no need to worry about that just now Let us examine our prison and see what it is like The space underneath the roof where they stood permitted them to see on all sides of the tall building and they looked with much curiosity at the city spread out beneath them Everything visible was made of wood and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural From their platform a stair descended into the
