anted to travel and now I AM traveling Not many people have flown through the air on a rock C4 why its really a rocket decided Mandy with a nervous giggle And that I suppose makes me the first rocketrider in the country and the LAST too she finished soberly as she measured with her eye the distance she would plunge when her rock started earthward Now if wed just come down in that blue lake below I might have a chance Perhaps I should jump But by the time Mandy made up her mind to jump the lake was far behind and nothing but a great desert of smoking sand stretched beneath her CHAPTER 2 THE END OF THE RIDE The sky from the rosy pink of late afternoon had faded to a depressing grey and Mandy could not help thinking longingly of the appetizing little supper she had set out for herself before going up to call the goats Who would eat it now or even know she was flying through the air like a comet No one she concluded drearily for Mandy was an orphan and lived all by herself in a small cottage on Mt Mern high above the village of Fistikins In a day or two some of her friends in the village might search the cottage and find her gone but NOW now there was nothing to do but sit tight and hope for the best Mandys next glance down was more encouraging Instead of the dangerouslooking desert she was sailing over misty blue hills and valleys dotted with many small towns and villages High as she was she could even hear the church bells tolling the hour and this made Mandy feel more lost and lonely than ever All these people below were safely at home and about to eat their suppers while she was flying high and far from everything she knew and loved best Hungrily the Goat Girl cast her eyes over the rock she was riding thinking to find a small sprig of mountain berries or even a blade of grass to nibble At first glance the rock seemed bare and barren then sticking up out of a narrow crevice Mandy spied a tiny blue flower Poor little posy its as far from home as I am murmured the Goat Girl and carefully breaking the stem she lifted the blue flower to her nose Its faint fragrance was vaguely comforting and Mandy had just begun to count the petals when the rock gave a sickening lurch and started to pitch down so fast Mandys braids snapped like jumping ropes and her skirts bellied out like a parachute in a gale NOW for it gasped the Goat Girl closing her eyes and clenching her teeth OH My poor little shins Mandys shins were both stout and sturdy but even so we cannot blame Mandy for pitying them Stouter shins than hers would have splintered at such a fall Hardly knowing what she was doing Mandy began to pull the petals from the blue flower calling in an agonized voice as she pulled each one the names of her goats and friends She had just come to Speckle the smallest member of her flock when the end came Kimmeny Jimmeny Was this ALL Opening one eye the Goat Girl looked fearfully about her She was sitting on top of a haystack no not a haystack but a heap of soft blue flower petals as soft as down Opening the other eye she saw the rock on which she had traveled so far bump over a golden fence and fall with a satisfied splash into a shimmering lake But what lay beyond the lake made Mandy forget all her troubles and fairly moan with surprise and pleasure A CASTLE exulted the Goat Girl putting one hand above her heart Oh Ive always wanted to see a castle and now I AM And this castle let me tell you was well worth anyones seeing a castle of lacy blue marble carved and decorated with precious stones in a way to astonish the eyes of a simple mountain lass From the tallest tower a silken pennant floated lazily in the evening breeze KERETARIA Mandy spelled out slowly Sliding off the heap of flower petals she stood for a long delicious moment lost in admiration Then giving herself a businesslike shake to be sure she was not broken or bent by her amazing flight and tumble Mandy turned to examine the rest of her surroundings When she looked at the spot on which she had fallen the stack of blue petals had disappeared but there twinkling up cheerfully was the blue flower as much at home as if it had grown there in the first place Thoroughly puzzled Mandy picked the little flower a second time and slipped it into the pocket of her apron Even without the mystery of the blue flower it was astonishing enough to find herself in the stately park of this gorgeous blue castle There was a treelined avenue and velvety lawns splashed with starshaped flower beds stretched in every direction Only the small patch of land on which she was standing was bare and uncultivated And evidently someone was at work here for a great white ox with golden horns yoked to a gold plow stood with his back to Mandy dozing cozily in the pleasant dusk At sight of the ox Mandy gave a little sigh of relief and content Long ago an old mountain woman had given her this sensible piece of advice When you do not know what to do next do the first useful piece of work that comes to han
