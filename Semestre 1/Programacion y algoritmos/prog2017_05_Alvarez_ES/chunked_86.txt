ery nervous at the delay but if you will mount into the air I think we can discover which way Glinda has gone LineArt Drawing 261 Very well returned the Gump quietly and it spread its great wings and mounted high into the air Far away across the meadows they could now see two tiny specks speeding one after the other and they knew these specks must be the Griffin and the SawHorse So Tip called the Gumps attention to them and bade the creature try to overtake the Witch and the Sorceress But swift as was the Gumps flight the pursued and pursuer moved more swiftly yet and within a few moments were blotted out against the dim horizon Let us continue to follow them nevertheless said the Scarecrow for the Land of Oz is of small extent and sooner or later they must both come to a halt Old Mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a Griffin for its legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more enduring than that of other animals But she had not reckoned on the untiring energy of the SawHorse whose wooden limbs could run for days without slacking their speed Therefore after an hours hard running the Griffins breath began to fail and it panted and gasped painfully and moved more slowly than before Then it reached the edge of the desert and began racing across the deep sands But its tired feet sank far 262 into the sand and in a few minutes the Griffin fell forward completely exhausted and lay still upon the desert waste Glinda came up a moment later riding the still vigorous SawHorse and having unwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the Sorceress threw it over the head of the panting and helpless Griffin and so destroyed the magical power of Mombis transformation For the animal with one fierce shudder disappeared from view while in its place was discovered the form of the old Witch glaring savagely at the serene and beautiful face of the Sorceress LineArt Drawing 263 Full page lineart drawing 264 Princess Ozma of Oz You are my prisoner and it is useless for you to struggle any longer said Glinda in her soft sweet voice Lie still a moment and rest yourself and then I will carry you back to my tent Why do you seek me asked Mombi still scarce able to speak plainly for lack of breath What have I done to you to be so persecuted You have done nothing to me answered the gentle Sorceress but I suspect you have been guilty of several wicked actions and if I find it is true that you have so abused your knowledge of magic I intend to punish you severely I defy you croaked the old hag You dare not harm me Just then the Gump flew up to them and alighted upon the desert sands beside Glinda Our friends 265 were delighted to find that Mombi had finally been captured and after a hurried consultation it was decided they should all return to the camp in the Gump So the SawHorse was tossed aboard and then Glinda still holding an end of the golden thread that was around Mombis neck forced her prisoner to climb into the sofas The others now followed and Tip gave the word to the Gump to return The Journey was made in safety Mombi sitting in her place with a grim and sullen air for the old hag was absolutely helpless so long as the magical thread encircled her throat The army hailed Glindas return with loud cheers and the party of friends soon gathered again in the royal tent which had been neatly repaired during their absence Now said the Sorceress to Mombi I want you to tell us why the Wonderful Wizard of Oz paid you three visits and what became of the child Ozma which so curiously disappeared The Witch looked at Glinda defiantly but said not a word Answer me cried the Sorceress But still Mombi remained silent Perhaps she doesnt know remarked Jack I beg you will keep quiet said Tip You might spoil everything with your foolishness 266 Very well dear father returned the Pumpkinhead meekly How glad I am to be a WoggleBug murmured the Highly Magnified Insect softly No one can expect wisdom to flow from a pumpkin Well said the Scarecrow what shall we do to make Mombi speak Unless she tells us what we wish to know her capture will do us no good at all Suppose we try kindness suggested the Tin Woodman Ive heard that anyone can be conquered with kindness no matter how ugly they may be At this the Witch turned to glare upon him so horribly that the Tin Woodman shrank back abashed Glinda had been carefully considering what to do and now she turned to Mombi and said You will gain nothing I assure you by thus defying us For I am determined to learn the truth about the girl Ozma and unless you tell me all that you know I will certainly put you to death Oh no Dont do that exclaimed the Tin Woodman It would be an awful thing to kill anyoneeven old Mombi But it is merely a threat returned Glinda I shall not put Mombi to death because she will prefer to tell me the truth Oh I see said the tin man much relieved 267 Suppose I tell you all that you wish to know said Mombi speaking so suddenly that she startled them all What will y
