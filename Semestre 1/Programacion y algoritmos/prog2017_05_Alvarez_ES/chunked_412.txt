 below the Crescent Cant tell about these Sky Countries till you try them Ill bet its nothing but a cake of ice shivered Jellia hugging herself to keep warm Being of tin I dont suppose youd notice that it was freezing I wonder if that stove lights Ice meditated Nick as Jellia hurried toward the back of the cabin Why I do believe you are right my dear In the upper stratas the air does become colder We probably cracked through a frozen cloud Jellia turning all the switches on the stove paid little attention to Nicks scientific discourse She was too busy warming herself over the glowing burners If we just had something to cook sighed the little Oz maid staring wistfully into the cupboard beside the stove But the shelves were perfectly empty Reflecting that the Wizard had not yet had time to stock up for the flight Jellia who was an orderly little soul began picking up the china that had broken when it fell from the cabinet the night before Rather pompously the Soldier with Green Whiskers began to help her Will someone kindly explain what we are doing flying around in this dangerous and haphazard manner he inquired loftily I understood we were to wait for Ozmas return before we made a trial flight And really you know Im needed at home to guard the castle Oh indeed sniffed Jellia And who do you suppose started us off Mr Whiskers Nobody but yourself A fine pickle you put us in when you fell on that steering board I The Solder straightened up aghast Yes YOU declared Jellia You and your pickles Sweeping the rest of the broken plates into her skirt she marched to the end of the cabin and dumped them into the big basket beside the water cooler Goodness knows whether we shall ever get back she sighed sinking despondently into the last seat and staring out the window But were backing now muttered the Soldier This was quite true for Nick to avoid hitting the crescent of ice again was maneuvering the plane from beneath then feeling it might be dangerous to go any higher he began slowly and cautiously to descend Neither he nor Jellia paid any more attention to the Soldier with Green Whiskers who glanced uncomfortably from one to the other After a little silence he remarked in a hollow voice I shall consider myself under arrest I shall walk guard for two hours without a pause for rest or rations Oh dont be a goose giggled Jellia Youll probably go without rations because there arent any But what good will walking guard do As CommanderinChief I have sentenced myself to walk guard As a firstclass Private in the Army of Oz I shall carry out this sentence insisted the Soldier Discipline must be maintained Hoisting his oldfashioned blunderbuss to his shoulder he began tramping stiffly up and down the short aisle of the cabin Born in a small Munchkin village to a family named Battles who had promptly christened him Wantowin he had applied as soon as he was grown for a position in the army of Oz The Wizard then Supreme Ruler of the Kingdom impressed by the Soldiers height and long green whiskers had immediately hired him Later he had been promoted by Ozma to fill the position of the entire staff and army of Oz Wantowin had never been much of a fighter but as war in Oz is practically outlawed and victories usually won by magic he had got on very well At his tenth aboutface Wantowin suddenly recalled the piece of cake he had stuffed into his pocket the night before and generously offered it to Jellia Oh Wanny how wonderful To the famished girl the cake tasted even better than it had at the Wizards party Breaking it in half she tried to force the soldier to eat a piece but raising his hand sternly Wantowin continued his selfimposed sentence Seeing argument was useless Jellia ate her own share and put the other half in the cupboard for the soldiers supper The plane was still slanting smoothly downward After oiling all of Nicks joints and thinking how fortunate it was they had brought along the oil can Jellia began marching up and down behind the Soldier examining the pictures and charts on the wall as she went along The cake and a long drink of water from the cooler had done much to restore her courage and cheerfulness and an occasional glance out the window was both pleasant and reassuring The Oztober was dropping through fluffs and puffs of creamy cloud Just like whipped cream on strawberries C4 if we had any strawberries mused Jellia withdrawing her gaze reluctantly from the window and resuming her march Oh Nick here are some directions she cried suddenly stepping before a finely printed notice beside the water cooler Directions The Tin Woodman looked round rather annoyed He felt he had almost mastered the mechanism of the Ozoplane and did not care to start a new system But the directions that Jellia read off had nothing to do with the navigation of the plane They were rules for the behavior of passengers in the strat The air in this cabin has been magically treated stated the notice So long as the windows and doors are closed ride
