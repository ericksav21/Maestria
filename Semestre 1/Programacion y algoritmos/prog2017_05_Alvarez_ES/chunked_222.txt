f it had been bitten off by some one who was fond of candy and couldnt resist the temptation The wax doll Queen spoke prettily to Dorothy and the others and sent her loving greetings to Ozma before she retired to the rooms prepared for her She had brought a birthday present wrapped in tissue paper and tied with pink and blue ribbons and one of the wooden soldiers placed it on the table with the other gifts But the Candy Man did not go to his room because he said he preferred to stay and talk with the Scarecrow and Tiktok and the Wizard and Tin Woodman whom he declared the queerest people he had ever met ButtonBright was glad the Candy Man stayed in the Throne Room because the boy thought this guest smelled deliciously of wintergreen and maple sugar The Braided Man now entered the room having been fortunate enough to receive an invitation to the Princess Ozmas party He was from a cave halfway between the Invisible Valley and the Country of the Gargoyles and his hair and whiskers were so long that he was obliged to plait them into many braids that hung to his feet and every braid was tied with a bow of colored ribbon Ive brought Princess Ozma a box of flutters for her birthday said the Braided Man earnestly and I hope she will like them for they are the finest quality I have ever made Im sure she will be greatly pleased said Dorothy who remembered the Braided Man well and the Wizard introduced the guest to the rest of the company and made him sit down in a chair and keep quiet for if allowed he would talk continually about his flutters The band then played a welcome to another set of guests and into the ThroneRoom swept the handsome and stately Queen of Ev Beside her was young King Evardo and following them came the entire royal family of five Princesses and four Princes of Ev The Kingdom of Ev lay just across the Deadly Desert to the North of Oz and once Ozma and her people had rescued the Queen of Ev and her ten children from the Nome King who had enslaved them Dorothy had been present on this adventure so she greeted the royal family cordially and all the visitors were delighted to meet the little Kansas girl again They knew Tiktok and Billina too and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman as well as the Lion and Tiger so there was a joyful reunion as you may imagine and it was fully an hour before the Queen and her train retired to their rooms Perhaps they would not have gone then had not the band begun to play to announce new arrivals but before they left the great ThroneRoom King Evardo added to Ozmas birthday presents a diadem of diamonds set in radium The next comer proved to be King Renard of Foxville or King Dox as he preferred to be called He was magnificently dressed in a new feather costume and wore white kid mittens over his paws and a flower in his buttonhole and had his hair parted in the middle King Dox thanked Dorothy fervently for getting him the invitation to come to Oz which he all his life longed to visit He strutted around rather absurdly as he was introduced to all the famous people assembled in the ThroneRoom and when he learned that Dorothy was a Princess of Oz the Fox King insisted on kneeling at her feet and afterward retired backwarda dangerous thing to do as he might have stubbed his paw and tumbled over No sooner was he gone than the blasts of bugles and clatter of drums and cymbals announced important visitors and the High Chamberlain assumed his most dignified tone as he threw open the door and said proudly Her Sublime and Resplendent Majesty Queen Zixi of Ix His Serene and Tremendous Majesty King Bud of Noland Her Royal Highness the Princess Fluff That three such high and mighty royal personages should arrive at once was enough to make Dorothy and her companions grow solemn and assume their best company manners but when the exquisite beauty of Queen Zixi met their eyes they thought they had never beheld anything so charming Dorothy decided that Zixi must be about sixteen years old but the Wizard whispered to her that this wonderful queen had lived thousands of years but knew the secret of remaining always fresh and beautiful King Bud of Noland and his dainty fairhaired sister the Princess Fluff were friends of Zixi as their kingdoms were adjoining so they had traveled together from their faroff domains to do honor to Ozma of Oz on the occasion of her birthday They brought many splendid gifts so the table was now fairly loaded down with presents Dorothy and Polly loved the Princess Fluff the moment they saw her and little King Bud was so frank and boyish that ButtonBright accepted him as a chum at once and did not want him to go away But it was after noon now and the royal guests must prepare their toilets for the grand banquet at which they were to assemble that evening to meet the reigning Princess of this Fairyland so Queen Zixi was shown to her room by a troop of maidens led by Jellia Jamb and Bud and Fluff presently withdrew to their own apartments My what a big party Ozma is goin
