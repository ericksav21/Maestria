f time to select his objects not one did the poor Scarecrow guess aright So he became a solid gold cardreceiver and the beautiful but terrible palace awaited its next visitor Its all over remarked the King with a sigh of satisfaction and it has been a very amusing performance except for the one good guess the Kansas girl made I am richer by a great many pretty ornaments It is my turn now said Billina briskly Oh Id forgotten you said the King But you neednt go if you dont wish to I will be generous and let you off No you wont replied the hen I insist upon having my guesses as you promised Then go ahead you absurd feathered fool grumbled the King and he caused the opening that led to the palace to appear once more Dont go Billina said Dorothy earnestly It isnt easy to guess those ornments and only luck saved me from being one myself Stay with me and well go back to the Land of Ev together Im sure this little Prince will give us a home Indeed I will said Evring with much dignity Dont worry my dear cried Billina with a cluck that was meant for a laugh I may not be human but Im no fool if I AM a chicken Oh Billina said Dorothy you havent been a chicken in a long time Not since youyouve beengrown up Perhaps thats true answered Billina thoughtfully But if a Kansas farmer sold me to some one what would he call mea hen or a chicken You are not a Kansas farmer Billina replied the girl and you said Never mind that Dorothy Im going I wont say goodbye because Im coming back Keep up your courage for Ill see you a little later Then Billina gave several loud cluckclucks that seemed to make the fat little King MORE nervous than ever and marched through the entrance into the enchanted palace I hope Ive seen the last of THAT bird declared the monarch seating himself again in his throne and mopping the perspiration from his forehead with his rockcolored handkerchief Hens are bothersome enough at their best but when they can talk theyre simply dreadful Billinas my friend said Dorothy quietly She may not always be zactly polite but she MEANS well Im sure 16 Purple Green and Gold The yellow hen stepping high and with an air of vast importance walked slowly over the rich velvet carpets of the splendid palace examining everything she met with her sharp little eyes Billina had a right to feel important for she alone shared the Nome Kings secret and knew how to tell the objects that were transformations from those that had never been alive She was very sure that her guesses would be correct but before she began to make them she was curious to behold all the magnificence of this underground palace which was perhaps one of the most splendid and beautiful places in any fairyland As she went through the rooms she counted the purple ornaments and although some were small and hidden in queer places Billina spied them all and found the entire ten scattered about the various rooms The green ornaments she did not bother to count for she thought she could find them all when the time came Finally having made a survey of the entire palace and enjoyed its splendor the yellow hen returned to one of the rooms where she had noticed a large purple footstool She placed a claw upon this and said Ev and at once the footstool vanished and a lovely lady tall and slender and most beautifully robed stood before her The ladys eyes were round with astonishment for a moment for she could not remember her transformation nor imagine what had restored her to life Good morning maam said Billina in her sharp voice Youre looking quite well considering your age Who speaks demanded the Queen of Ev drawing herself up proudly Why my names Bill by rights answered the hen who was now perched upon the back of a chair although Dorothy has put scollops on it and made it Billina But the name doesnt matter Ive saved you from the Nome King and you are a slave no longer Then I thank you for the gracious favor said the Queen with a graceful courtesy But my childrentell me I beg of youwhere are my children and she clasped her hands in anxious entreaty Dont worry advised Billina pecking at a tiny bug that was crawling over the chair back Just at present they are out of mischief and perfectly safe for they cant even wiggle What mean you O kindly stranger asked the Queen striving to repress her anxiety Theyre enchanted said Billina just as you have beenall that is except the little fellow Dorothy picked out And the chances are that they have been good boys and girls for some time because they couldnt help it Oh my poor darlings cried the Queen with a sob of anguish Not at all returned the hen Dont let their condition make you unhappy maam because Ill soon have them crowding round to bother and worry you as naturally as ever Come with me if you please and Ill show you how pretty they look She flew down from her perch and walked into the next room the Queen following As she passed a low table a small green grasshopper caught her eye and instantly Billina pounced upon it and snapped it
