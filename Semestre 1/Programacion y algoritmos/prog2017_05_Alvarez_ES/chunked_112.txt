ive boys and five girlsof the former King of Ev by name Evoldo have been enslaved by the Nome King and are held prisoners in his underground palace Also that there was no one in Ev powerful enough to release them Naturally our Ozma wished to undertake the adventure of liberating the poor prisoners but for a long time she could find no way to cross the great desert between the two countries Finally she went to a friendly sorceress of our land named Glinda the Good who heard the story and at once presented Ozma a magic carpet which would continually unroll beneath our feet and so make a comfortable path for us to cross the desert As soon as she had received the carpet our gracious Ruler ordered me to assemble our army which I did You behold in these bold warriors the pick of all the finest soldiers of Oz and if we are obliged to fight the Nome King every officer as well as the private will battle fiercely unto death Then Tiktok spoke Why should you fight the Nome King he asked He has done no wrong No wrong cried Dorothy Isnt it wrong to imprison a queen mother and her ten children They were sold to the Nome King by King Evoldo replied Tiktok It was the King of Ev who did wrong and when he realized what he had done he jumped into the sea and drowned himself This is news to me said Ozma thoughtfully I had supposed the Nome King was all to blame in the matter But in any case he must be made to liberate the prisoners My uncle Evoldo was a very wicked man declared the Princess Langwidere If he had drowned himself before he sold his family no one would have cared But he sold them to the powerful Nome King in exchange for a long life and afterward destroyed the life by jumping into the sea Then said Ozma he did not get the long life and the Nome King must give up the prisoners Where are they confined No one knows exactly replied the Princess For the king whose name is Roquat of the Rocks owns a splendid palace underneath the great mountain which is at the north end of this kingdom and he has transformed the queen and her children into ornaments and bricabrac with which to decorate his rooms Id like to know said Dorothy who this Nome King is I will tell you replied Ozma He is said to be the Ruler of the Underground World and commands the rocks and all that the rocks contain Under his rule are many thousands of the Nomes who are queerly shaped but powerful sprites that labor at the furnaces and forges of their king making gold and silver and other metals which they conceal in the crevices of the rocks so that those living upon the earths surface can only find them with great difficulty Also they make diamonds and rubies and emeralds which they hide in the ground so that the kingdom of the Nomes is wonderfully rich and all we have of precious stones and silver and gold is what we take from the earth and rocks where the Nome King has hidden them I understand said Dorothy nodding her little head wisely For the reason that we often steal his treasures continued Ozma the Ruler of the Underground World is not fond of those who live upon the earths surface and never appears among us If we wish to see King Roquat of the Rocks we must visit his own country where he is all powerful and therefore it will be a dangerous undertaking But for the sake of the poor prisoners said Dorothy we ought to do it We shall do it replied the Scarecrow although it requires a lot of courage for me to go near to the furnaces of the Nome King For I am only stuffed with straw and a single spark of fire might destroy me entirely The furnaces may also melt my tin said the Tin Woodman but I am going I cant bear heat remarked the Princess Langwidere yawning lazily so I shall stay at home But I wish you may have success in your undertaking for I am heartily tired of ruling this stupid kingdom and I need more leisure in which to admire my beautiful heads We do not need you said Ozma For if with the aid of my brave followers I cannot accomplish my purpose then it would be useless for you to undertake the journey Quite true sighed the Princess So if youll excuse me I will now retire to my cabinet Ive worn this head quite awhile and I want to change it for another When she had left them and you may be sure no one was sorry to see her go Ozma said to Tiktok Will you join our party I am the slave of the girl Dorothy who rescued me from prison replied the machine Where she goes I will go Oh I am going with my friends of course said Dorothy quickly I wouldnt miss the fun for anything Will you go too Billina To be sure said Billina in a careless tone She was smoothing down the feathers of her back and not paying much attention Heat is just in her line remarked the Scarecrow If she is nicely roasted she will be better than ever Then said Ozma we will arrange to start for the Kingdom of the Nomes at daybreak tomorrow And in the meantime we will rest and prepare ourselves for the journey Although Princess Langwidere did not again appear to her guests the palace serv
