e to Skamperoos ear There are three things that must be done before your wish can be realized Matiah spoke tensely FirstFF20FF20FF20 secondFF20FF20FF20 thirdFF20FF20FF20 After each short whispered direction Skamperoo nodded to show that he understood Then it will take four wishes to do it he sighed resting his elbows heavily on the table That will be four weeks wont it No perhaps if we are careful we can work it all into one answered Matiah thoughtfully and taking up his bit of silk he began polishing the emeralds with renewed vigor The King watching him forgot his former dislike and distrust Matiahs enthusiastic approval of his plans made him feel that perhaps he had misjudged this longfaced whiskered stranger Perhaps he would not wish him away after all He might prove very useful in the strange and magnificent future that stretched ahead Matiah on his part had no such kindly intentions toward the King He merely meant to make Skamperoos wish his own and so grand and daring was the prospect that he grew more impatient than ever to discover the way to accomplish it Holding all three necklaces up to the light he squinted at them anxiously The chains seemed identical in every respect but no C4 what was this One had a diamond clasp while the clasps on the other two were of flattened emeralds This then was the solution The magic wishing power undoubtedly rested in the diamond clasp Revealing in no way his satisfaction and elation over this important discovery Matiah handed the necklaces back to the King Somehow decided the merchant he must make Skamperoo touch the diamond clasp while he silently repeated the Kings wish but before that he needed a little time to prepare himself for the grand and glorious years that were to be his As Skamperoo exhausted by so much thinking early in the morning waddled wearily over to his throne Matiah strode to the bookshelves located in an adjoining room While your Majesty rests I will have a look at this interesting library he murmured ingratiatingly and at the same time store up some useful information for the future Skamperoo sleepily returned the merchants broad wink then sinking back among his cushions closed his eyes From his chair in the alcove Matiah could keep the King in view and satisfied that Skamperoo was really asleep he began hurriedly turning over the pages of the large volume Pinny Penny had but that morning returned to the shelves Soon he became so absorbed that he forgot all about the King And that was a pity for had he taken the trouble to look he would have discovered that the King was no longer there CHAPTER 4 THE KING AND HIS TALKING HORSE Now it is true that the King had closed his eyes as Matiah settled himself in the alcove to read but he was very far from asleep In fact no more than five minutes had been ticked away by the oldfashioned clock in the corner before Skamperoo straightened up as if suddenly struck by lightning Casting a cautious look at the quiet merchant he began to slide rapidly toward the door Opening it without a sound he slipped out into the corridor and closing it just as softly went puffing away to the quarters of the White Wishing Horse at the back of the courtyard Though usually unenterprising and dull we must credit Skamperoo with one brilliant idea As Chalk had been brought to Skampavia by the magic emeralds why should he not know the trick of using them Fairly panting with eagerness and impatience Skamperoo jerked open the door of the stable and stepped recklessly into Chalks stall Ah the little Kingaling whinnied Chalk tossing his mane gaily For some reason or other he found his fat master tremendously amusing and while he had an immediate desire to trample on Matiah and frighten off the stable boys he felt only an affectionate tolerance for the tubby little ruler of Skampavia Have you come for your ride he inquired giving the King a playful poke with his soft nose No Ive come to talk to you wheezed Skamperoo seating himself carefully on an overturned water bucket Quick tell me all you know about these magic emeralds Touching his three necklaces with a trembling forefinger the King looked imploringly into the face of his new and powerful steed Humph Chalk shifted a mouthful of hay to his other cheek Well as to that or rather them all that I know is nothing You forget that I only came into existence yesterday afternoon Of course of course I was the one who wished you here explained the King impatiently You wished me here mused Chalk staring meditatively at the comical figure on the water bucket Well I hardly know whether to thank you or to jump on you with all four feet Even without any experience at all I can see that this is no place for me Youre right sighed Skamperoo clasping his knees dejectedly Its no place for me either That is why I must know about the emeralds They can satisfy our every wish and if we just knew how to use them we could go away together You think you could manage that sniffed Chalk who had his own opinion
