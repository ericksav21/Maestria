st Samuel making notes Tandy sketches and Ato catching in his longhandled nets plump little fish and crabs and filling another basket with the small delicious clams that clung like barnacles to the slippery bark of the sea trees In the shadowy center of the forest where the trees pressed closer together and great flat rocks stuck their heads out of the water the explorers came upon several fierce sea lions They were not smooth and shiny like the seals of our own oceans but yellow and tawny with long yellow tusks tufted tails and scaly manes Their front legs ended in sharp claws their back legs were shorter and their feet were webbed for swimming Only the fact that Nikobo was larger and more frightening to the sea lions than they were to her saved the party from a savage attack by these maliciouslooking monsters As it was they retired sullenly into the deeper shadows snarling and roaring defiance as they backed away but not before Tandy had made an effective sketch of the whole group FF20Tis a lucky thing for us that youre along grunted Ato drawing his feet up out of the water and looking with grim disfavor after the snarling sea lions Likely as not if you had not made that picture Samuel would have tried to drag one along by its tail regardless of our feelings or safety A wild maned sea lion would be a valuable addition to any collection sighed Samuel Salt shaking his head regretfully But thenFF20C4 He grinned in his sudden pleasant way Not much of a mascot at that The only other happening of note was Rogers capture of a monkey fish Unable to overtake a flying fish the Read Bird had pounced on this small combination of a land and water beast as it sat quietly sunning itself on the limb of a tree Screaming and chattering he bore it proudly down to the Captain and Samuel was so pleased with the curious little creature that when Nikobo suggested going back he made no serious objection And as the hippopotamus rather weary from her long swim headed thankfully back for the ship Tandy and Samuel made ambitious plans for the monkey fishs care and comfort Thrusting it into Tandys bird cage Samuel regarded it with increasing enthusiasm and interest Ill rig up a wooden tree in one of the aquariums set the aquarium in one of the large cages so itll have both air and water and call it Roger after its discoverer beamed the former Pirate with a wink at Tandy Dont you dare call that monkey fish after me screeched the Read Bird flying round to have another look at his strange prize Why its uglier than a blue monkey Looks like a regular goblin if you ask me And to tell the truth the monkey fish was even uglier than a goblin shaped like a monkey but scaled all over and with unpleasant goggly eyes and three short spikes sticking out of its forehead It does look like a goblin agreed Tandy with an amused sniff But lets call it Mofi which is short for fish and monkey Tip topsls approved Samuel Salt taking out his notebook Wonder what it eats Great grandmothers what would it eat moaned Ato looking blankly at Samuel Another mouth to feed and listen to Dear Dear and DEAR Oh give it a box of animal crackers put in Roger carelessly No I brought along some goldfish food for just such an emergency as this declared Samuel making a little flourish with his pencil as he wrote busily in his journal Goldfish food will be splendid for a monkey fish Well dont forget the bananas for remember its a monkey too chirped Roger settling on the Captains shoulder to read what he had written So laughing and joking and in the highest good humor the exploring party returned to the Crescent Moon What with planting the slips from the sea tree settling Mofi in his aquarium cage pressing the leaves from the marine forest and making copies and further notes about the sea lions in his journal Samuel did not get his ship under way till late afternoon Ramming into the sea tree beyond scraping off some paint had done little damage so singing boisterously Samuel finally heaved up his anchor And soon with Ato stirring up a huge clam chowder Tandy painting the sea forest on the chart and Roger scouring the hold for Mofis fish food the Crescent Moon again dipped adventurously into the southeast swell CHAPTER 14 THE SEA UNICORN Ahoy And how goes it with the ablebodied seaman called Roger swooping down from the foremast Tandy polishing the brass trim on the binnacle looked up with a welcoming grin Tip topsails he answered pausing a minute to stare off toward the skyline to see whether any islands or sea serpents were visible And look at that muscle now marveled Roger touching Tandys arm admiringly with his claw Youre twice the lad you were Mate and Ill wager my last feather you can lay any lubber by the heels If anyone gets freshwater ashore remember youre a salt seagoing sailor and you just take a poke at him Thats my advice without any charge or obligation But then again a chap thats a King the Royal Artist of an exploring expedition with a sea forest named after him
