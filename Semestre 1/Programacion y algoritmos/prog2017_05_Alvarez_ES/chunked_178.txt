nt be impudent Eureka admonished Dorothy It is you who are impudent said Eureka for accusing me of such a crime when you cant prove it except by guessing Ozma was now greatly incensed by the kittens conduct She summoned her CaptainGeneral and when the long lean officer appeared she said Carry this cat away to prison and keep her in safe confinement until she is tried by law for the crime of murder So the CaptainGeneral took Eureka from the arms of the now weeping Dorothy and in spite of the kittens snarls and scratches carried it away to prison What shall we do now asked the Scarecrow with a sigh for such a crime had cast a gloom over all the company I will summon the Court to meet in the Throne Room at three oclock replied Ozma I myself will be the judge and the kitten shall have a fair trial What will happen if she is guilty asked Dorothy She must die answered the Princess Nine times enquired the Scarecrow As many times as is necessary was the reply I will ask the Tin Woodman to defend the prisoner because he has such a kind heart I am sure he will do his best to save her And the WoggleBug shall be the Public Accuser because he is so learned that no one can deceive him Who will be the jury asked the Tin Woodman There ought to be several animals on the jury said Ozma because animals understand each other better than we people understand them So the jury shall consist of the Cowardly Lion the Hungry Tiger Jim the Cabhorse the Yellow Hen the Scarecrow the Wizard Tiktok the Machine Man the Sawhorse and Zeb of Hugsons Ranch That makes the nine which the law requires and all my people shall be admitted to hear the testimony They now separated to prepare for the sad ceremony for whenever an appeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to followeven in a fairyland like Oz But is must be stated that the people of that Land were generally so wellbehaved that there was not a single lawyer amongst them and it had been years since any Ruler had sat in judgment upon an offender of the law The crime of murder being the most dreadful crime of all tremendous excitement prevailed in the Emerald City when the news of Eurekas arrest and trial became known The Wizard when he returned to his own room was exceedingly thoughtful He had no doubt Eureka had eaten his piglet but he realized that a kitten cannot be depended upon at all times to act properly since its nature is to destroy small animals and even birds for food and the tame cat that we keep in our houses today is descended from the wild cat of the junglea very ferocious creature indeed The Wizard knew that if Dorothys pet was found guilty and condemned to death the little girl would be made very unhappy so although he grieved over the piglets sad fate as much as any of them he resolved to save Eurekas life Sending for the Tin Woodman the Wizard took him into a corner and whispered My friend it is your duty to defend the white kitten and try to save her but I fear you will fail because Eureka has long wished to eat a piglet to my certain knowledge and my opinion is that she has been unable to resist the temptation Yet her disgrace and death would not bring back the piglet but only serve to make Dorothy unhappy So I intend to prove the kittens innocence by a trick He drew from his inside pocket one of the eight tiny piglets that were remaining and continued This creature you must hide in some safe place and if the jury decides that Eureka is guilty you may then produce this piglet and claim it is the one that was lost All the piglets are exactly alike so no one can dispute your word This deception will save Eurekas life and then we may all be happy again I do not like to deceive my friends replied the Tin Woodman still my kind heart urges me to save Eurekas life and I can usually trust my heart to do the right thing So I will do as you say friend Wizard After some thought he placed the little pig inside his funnelshaped hat and then put the hat upon his head and went back to his room to think over his speech to the jury 19 The Wizard Performs Another Trick At three oclock the Throne Room was crowded with citizens men women and children being eager to witness the great trial Princess Ozma dressed in her most splendid robes of state sat in the magnificent emerald throne with her jewelled sceptre in her hand and her sparkling coronet upon her fair brow Behind her throne stood the twentyeight officers of her army and many officials of the royal household At her right sat the queerly assorted Juryanimals animated dummies and peopleall gravely prepared to listen to what was said The kitten had been placed in a large cage just before the throne where she sat upon her haunches and gazed through the bars at the crowds around her with seeming unconcern And now at a signal from Ozma the WoggleBug arose and addressed the jury His tone was pompous and he strutted up and down in an absurd attempt to appear dignified Your Royal Highness and Fellow Citizens he began the small cat you
