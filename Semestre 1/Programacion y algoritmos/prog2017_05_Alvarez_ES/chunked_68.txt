of Oz could I hope to meet with so congenial a company That is true acknowledged the Pumpkinhead We are quite as congenial as flies and honey Butpardon me if I seem inquisitiveare you not all ratherahem rather unusual asked the WoggleBug looking from one to another with unconcealed interest Not more so than yourself answered the Scarecrow Everything in life is unusual until you get accustomed to it What rare philosophy exclaimed the WoggleBug admiringly Yes my brains are working well today admitted the Scarecrow an accent of pride in his voice Then if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed let us bend our steps toward the Emerald City suggested the magnified one We cant said Tip The SawHorse has broken a leg so he cant bend his steps And there is no wood around to make him a new limb from And we cant leave the horse behind because the Pumpkinhead is so stiff in his Joints that he has to ride 156 How very unfortunate cried the WoggleBug Then he looked the party over carefully and said If the Pumpkinhead is to ride why not use one of his legs to make a leg for the horse that carries him I judge that both are made of wood Now that is what I call real cleverness said the Scarecrow approvingly I wonder my brains did not think of that long ago Get to work my dear Nick and fit the Pumpkinheads leg to the SawHorse Jack was not especially pleased with this idea but he submitted to having his left leg amputated by the Tin Woodman and whittled down to fit the left leg of the SawHorse Nor was the SawHorse especially pleased with the operation either for he growled a good deal about being butchered as he called it and afterward declared that the new leg was a disgrace to a respectable SawHorse I beg you to be more careful in your speech said the Pumpkinhead sharply Remember if you please that it is my leg you are abusing I cannot forget it retorted the SawHorse for it is quite as flimsy as the rest of your person Flimsy me flimsy cried Jack in a rage How dare you call me flimsy Because you are built as absurdly as a jumping 157 jack sneered the horse rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner Even your head wont stay straight and you never can tell whether you are looking backwards or forwards Friends I entreat you not to quarrel pleaded the Tin Woodman anxiously As a matter of fact we are none of us above criticism so let us bear with each others faults An excellent suggestion said the WoggleBug approvingly You must have an excellent heart my metallic friend I have returned Nick well pleased My heart is quite the best part of me But now let us start upon our Journey They perched the onelegged Pumpkinhead upon the SawHorse and tied him to his seat with cords so that he could not possibly fall off And then following the lead of the Scarecrow they all advanced in the direction of the Emerald City LineArt Drawing 158 Full page lineart drawing 159 Old Mombi indulges in Witchcraft They soon discovered that the SawHorse limped for his new leg was a trifle too long So they were obliged to halt while the Tin Woodman chopped it down with his axe after which the wooden steed paced along more comfortably But the SawHorse was not entirely satisfied even yet It was a shame that I broke my other leg it growled On the contrary airily remarked the WoggleBug who was walking alongside you should consider the accident most fortunate For a horse is never of much use until he has been broken I beg your pardon said Tip rather provoked for he felt a warm interest in both the SawHorse and his man Jack but permit me to say that your joke is a poor one and as old as it is poor 160 Still it is a Joke declared the WoggleBug firmly and a Joke derived from a play upon words is considered among educated people to be eminently proper What does that mean enquired the Pumpkinhead stupidly It means my dear friend explained the WoggleBug that our language contains many words having a double meaning and that to pronounce a joke that allows both meanings of a certain word proves the joker a person of culture and refinement who has moreover a thorough command of the language I dont believe that said Tip plainly anybody can make a pun Not so rejoined the WoggleBug stiffly It requires education of a high order Are you educated young sir Not especially admitted Tip Then you cannot judge the matter I myself am Thoroughly Educated and I say that puns display genius For instance were I to ride upon this Saw Horse he would not only be an animal he would become an equipage For he would then be a horseandbuggy At this the Scarecrow gave a gasp and the Tin 161 Woodman stopped short and looked reproachfully at the WoggleBug At the same time the SawHorse loudly snorted his derision and even the Pumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile which because it was carved upon his face he could not change to a frown But the WoggleBug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark and the Scarecrow was obliged to say I have heard my dear friend that a person can b
