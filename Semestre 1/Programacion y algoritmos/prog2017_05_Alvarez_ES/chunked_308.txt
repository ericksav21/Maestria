 distrust upon the ship that had taken the place of their own How about that basket whispered Roger who had come out to help Ato in the galley Howd you like to be hoisted and lowered like a sail And for salts sake King dear dust the flour off your nose and put on your crown or this fellow will think youre King of the Cookies and Doughnuts Ha ha When hes tasted my plum cake hell not think it hell know it puffed Ato bustling happily from cupboard to cupboard Bring out the best tumblers and silver plates fetch up a dozen bottles of my famous Seapop from the hold and well have this island in our pocket before you can say Oz Robinson When Ato with one tray and Roger with another came out they found the Captain and the Prince of the Peaks striding up and down the deck in the friendliest conversation imaginable Matched in height and handsomeness the two were discussing with lively interest everything from ships and governments to the strange limestone that formed the crystalline rocks of Alberifs island Later seated around the table with Tandy and Roger passing plum cake and Seapop the Prince grew friendlier and more confidential still Weve never been conquered before admitted his Majesty with a puzzled smile but really I find it both interesting and enjoyable Just a matter of chance and luck said Samuel Salt with a modest wave of his hand Had I not had balloon sails on the Crescent Moon your ship would have cut us clean in two before we had time to put about That is what I always planned would happen to an enemy craft sighed Alberif Naturally our own ship the Mountain Lass would have been destroyed too but we could easily have built another That is what well have to do anyway as well never be able to haul her up the torrent Dont you do it begged Samuel Salt looking earnestly at the Mountain Monarch Ill send you a set of balloon sails as soon as I reach Elbow Island The Red Jinn presented me with two sets and Ill be delighted to send you one Once theyre set you can fly up as easily as we did and be ready for all and sundry even US if we come again Come and welcome beamed Alberif looking in some surprise at Sally who had just lifted her head above the rim of Samuels pipe bowl But tell me what am I to do now that I am conquered Surely something is required of us Nothing Nothing at all Samuel spoke earnestly and admiringly This island and your men are in fine shape and a great credit to you so just go on as you are but from this time forth youll be in contact with the famous and most modern Fairyland in History and if you are ever beset by enemies you can call upon Oz for assistance or help In time fruit foodstuffs books and merchandise will arrive from Oz and in return you may send back some of the sparkling crystals composing these mountains You might even invite a band of settlers from Oz to come and live as your loyal subjects here Gladly Gladly agreed the Prince his eyes sparkling at the prospect We have many uninhabited peaks and spires and could easily accommodate a thousand new bridge builders Come with me all of you to Skytop Tower and well run up the flag of Oz and sign a pledge of allegiance to her Majesty Queen Ozma AYE DE AYE OH LAY Running out on deck Alberif joyously beckoned to the men who operated the traveling basket inviting them all to enter Ato who had no intention of trusting his two hundred and fifty pounds to this strange conveyance shook the Prince regretfully by the hand Ill just watch it all from here said the ships cook firmly Ive pie to cook potatoes to peel and dinner to stir up for all hands and a hippopotamus so if youll kindly excuse meFF20C4 The Prince looked a little disappointed but cheered up as Samuel Roger and Tandy followed him into the basket Haul away yelled Samuel Salt winking at Ato and to the shrill tune of a ringing round of yodels their curious elevator rose from the deck spun merrily up to the Twin Peaks and highest bridge of Alberifs Mountain Used as he was to the tall masts and lofty rigging of the Crescent Moon Tandy felt sick and giddy as the basket swooped and swung upward But it came down safely at last and at sight of the shining spans of the lacy city spread out below and the glittering castle rising from the royal bridge Tandy forgot all his uneasiness With a little whistle of surprise and interest he followed Samuel and Alberif into the royal dwelling while Roger flew off on a little exploring expedition of his own Roger knew all about castles and was much more interested in the many windowed fluted cottages of the yodelers Ato watching from the deck of the Crescent Moon presently saw the flag of Oz fluttering from the top turret of the Castle Tower and with a little sigh of relief and pride he gathered up the empty pop bottles and padded off to his galley Soon Oz flags floated from the posts on all the bridgeheads adding much to the gaiety and beauty of Alberifs city From the Royal Bridge Tandy and Samuel had a splendid view and of his many experiences Tandy
