he seaweed trusses from Pigasus and clasping the basket in her arms climbed swiftly on his back Pigasus without one backward glance rose straight into the air and again headed north Dorothy peering fearfully over his left wing saw the Dooners spring suddenly to their feet and then like frightened prairie dogs disappear into many holes in the sand Funny mused Dorothy that they had not noticed these openings before Funny that the Dooners had stopped stumbling as soon as she and Pigasus had taken to the air Funny C4 but then everything was funny Right in the middle of her conjectures the box of stumbling blocks now closed and tied with a red ribbon dropped plink into the middle of her basket Someones throwing things gasped Pigasus flapping his wings a bit faster and looking rather wildly over his shoulder No just our box of stumbling blocks yawned Dorothy Now that the excitement was over she felt dreadfully tired and even the sight of the Nonestic Ocean rippling and gleaming a few yards ahead did not arouse or interest her It did not interest Pigasus either He was far from pleased to find himself so near the coast I dont like this I dont like this at all muttered the pig perking up his ears and wiggling his nose rapidly Weve flown straight north and instead of striking Thunder Mountain we strike the sea and how could a mountain be in the middle of the sea There are mountains on islands and I have a notion There are plenty of islands out there in the ocean said Dorothy sleepily recalling the days she had studied geography in the United States Take Japan for instance over there Mountains are simply everywhere I dont care if they are answered Pigasus fiercely I wont go to Japan and Ill not go a wings breadth over this ocean tonight islands or no islands Sahay Theres the North Star to our left so were not going north at all Were off our course thats what we are North Star North Star of course we are murmured Dorothy with a drowsy nod Youre asleep scolded Pigasus in a worried voice Id better land If you land too soon youll strike a dune warned Dorothy with another yawn And after a quick glance below and convinced they were still over the Dooners domain Pigasus spread his wings a bit wider and swung along the coast looking carefully for a safe place to land and spend the rest of the night He was so busy squinting downward that he never saw the long curious tubelike shadow shooting after him with incredible accuracy and speed A terrific blast of air as it rushed by them on the right was his first warning of danger Dorothy too caught unaware gave a faint shriek as an immense snakelike body curved back and began to coil round and round them like some gigantic air serpent It is a snake thought poor Dorothy as Pigasus clung helplessly in the little circle of air left in the center of its coils Neither spoke for truly there was nothing to say or do Then just as the suspense grew too awful to be endured the monster opened its mouth and Dorothy backing as far along the pigs back as she possibly could almost lost her balance Instead of a tongue or long tusks out popped the head and shoulders of a little old man no larger than Dorothy herself Pardon me he murmured politely I was looking for a sea serpent Do I look like a sea serpent snorted Pigasus in a quivering voice for he was still half choked from shock and fright If you and that monster youre riding are looking for a sea serpent go ahead C4 look for one but leave honest travelers alone Monster exclaimed the little man in a hurt voice Oh I say now you have us all wrong This is no monster this is the long strong flexible stretchable SHOOTING TOWER of my private castle and I myself am Bitty Bit the Seer of Some Summit In the short silence that followed Bitty Bits astonishing announcement Dorothy examining more closely the tubelike coils encircling herself and Pigasus saw that they really were of stone with rubberlike sections between What she had taken for a mouth was really a window With his elbow resting on the ledge Bitty Bit was regarding them fixedly Well even if you are a seer and have a shooting tower grunted Pigasus gathering courage as he went along there is no reason for you to come towering over us this way But a seer must be constantly looking for things explained Bitty Bit spreading his hands expansively That you know is his business I am always looking for something and tonight it happens to be sea serpents Sorry to disappoint you said Pigasus more mildly but since we are not sea serpents perhaps youll be good enough to unwind your tower As it happens I have a little looking to do myself As a matter of fact when you and your tower overtook us I was searching for a safe place for this young Princess and myself to spend the night Look no more begged Bitty Bit leaning so far over the sill Dorothy involuntarily put out her hand to save him from falling You shall both spend the night in my castle COME Grasping Dorothy by one hand and Pigasus by one wing the little
