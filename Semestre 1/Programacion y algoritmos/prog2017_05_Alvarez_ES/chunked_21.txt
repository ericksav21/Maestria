long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs Thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadfullooking monster could not be imagined It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror But being only tin the Woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed I am Oz the Great and Terrible spoke the Beast in a voice that was one great roar Who are you and why do you seek me I am a Woodman and made of tin Therefore I have no heart and cannot love I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are Why should I do this demanded the Beast Because I ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the Woodman Oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly If you indeed desire a heart you must earn it How asked the Woodman Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West replied the Beast When the Witch is dead come to me and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen They all wondered greatly at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself and the Lion said If he is a Beast when I go to see him I shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask And if he is the lovely Lady I shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding And if he is the great Head he will be at my mercy for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire So be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz The Lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a Ball of Fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it His first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door Then a low quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire and these were the words it spoke I am Oz the Great and Terrible Who are you and why do you seek me And the Lion answered I am a Cowardly Lion afraid of everything I came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts as men call me Why should I give you courage demanded Oz Because of all Wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the Lion The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time and the voice said Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead and that moment I will give you courage But as long as the Witch lives you must remain a coward The Lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room He was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard What shall we do now asked Dorothy sadly There is only one thing we can do returned the Lion and that is to go to the land of the Winkies seek out the Wicked Witch and destroy her But suppose we cannot said the girl Then I shall never have courage declared the Lion And I shall never have brains added the Scarecrow And I shall never have a heart spoke the Tin Woodman And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry said Dorothy beginning to cry Be careful cried the green girl The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it So Dorothy dried her eyes and said I suppose we must try it but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody even to see Aunt Em again I will go with you but Im too much of a coward to kill the Witch said the Lion I will go too declared the Scarecrow but I shall not be of much help to you I am such a fool I havent the heart to harm even a Witch remarked the Tin Woodman but if you go I certainly shall go with you Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better The green girl who was very kind to them filled Dorothys basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around Totos neck with a green ribbon They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the Palace and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg 12 The Search for the Wicked Witch The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his gre
