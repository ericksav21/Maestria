n is not really cowardly said Dorothy I have seen him act as bravely as can be All a mistake my dear protested the Lion gravely To others I may have seemed brave at times but I have never been in any danger that I was not afraid Nor I said Dorothy truthfully But I must go and set free Billina and then I will see you again She ran around to the back yard of the palace and soon found the chicken house being guided to it by a loud cackling and crowing and a distracting hubbub of sounds such as chickens make when they are excited Something seemed to be wrong in the chicken house and when Dorothy looked through the slats in the door she saw a group of hens and roosters huddled in one corner and watching what appeared to be a whirling ball of feathers It bounded here and there about the chicken house and at first Dorothy could not tell what it was while the screeching of the chickens nearly deafened her But suddenly the bunch of feathers stopped whirling and then to her amazement the girl saw Billina crouching upon the prostrate form of a speckled rooster For an instant they both remained motionless and then the yellow hen shook her wings to settle the feathers and walked toward the door with a strut of proud defiance and a cluck of victory while the speckled rooster limped away to the group of other chickens trailing his crumpled plumage in the dust as he went Why Billina cried Dorothy in a shocked voice have you been fighting I really think I have retorted Billina Do you think Id let that speckled villain of a rooster lord it over ME and claim to run this chicken house as long as Im able to peck and scratch Not if my name is Bill It isnt Bill its Billina and youre talking slang which is very undignfied said Dorothy reprovingly Come here Billina and Ill let you out for Ozma of Oz is here and has set us free So the yellow hen came to the door which Dorothy unlatched for her to pass through and the other chickens silently watched them from their corner without offering to approach nearer The girl lifted her friend in her arms and exclaimed Oh Billina how dreadful you look Youve lost a lot of feathers and one of your eyes is nearly pecked out and your comb is bleeding Thats nothing said Billina Just look at the speckled rooster Didnt I do him up brown Dorothy shook her head I dont prove of this at all she said carrying Billina away toward the palace It isnt a good thing for you to sociate with those common chickens They would soon spoil your good manners and you wouldnt be respecable any more I didnt ask to associate with them replied Billina It is that cross old Princess who is to blame But I was raised in the United States and I wont allow any onehorse chicken of the Land of Ev to run over me and put on airs as long as I can lift a claw in selfdefense Very well Billina said Dorothy We wont talk about it any more Soon they came to the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger to whom the girl introduced the Yellow Hen Glad to meet any friend of Dorothys said the Lion politely To judge by your present appearance you are not a coward as I am Your present appearance makes my mouth water said the Tiger looking at Billina greedily My my how good you would taste if I could only crunch you between my jaws But dont worry You would only appease my appetite for a moment so it isnt worth while to eat you Thank you said the hen nestling closer in Dorothys arms Besides it wouldnt be right continued the Tiger looking steadily at Billina and clicking his jaws together Of course not cried Dorothy hastily Billina is my friend and you mustnt ever eat her under any circmstances Ill try to remember that said the Tiger but Im a little absentminded at times Then Dorothy carried her pet into the drawingroom of the palace where Tiktok being invited to do so by Ozma had seated himself between the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman Opposite to them sat Ozma herself and the Princess Langwidere and beside them there was a vacant chair for Dorothy Around this important group was ranged the Army of Oz and as Dorothy looked at the handsome uniforms of the TwentySeven she said Why they seem to be all officers They are all except one answered the Tin Woodman I have in my Army eight Generals six Colonels seven Majors and five Captains besides one private for them to command Id like to promote the private for I believe no private should ever be in public life and Ive also noticed that officers usually fight better and are more reliable than common soldiers Besides the officers are more important looking and lend dignity to our army No doubt you are right said Dorothy seating herself beside Ozma And now announced the girlish Ruler of Oz we will hold a solemn conference to decide the best manner of liberating the royal family of this fair Land of Ev from their long imprisonment 9 The Royal Family of Ev The Tin Woodman was the first to address the meeting To begin with said he word came to our noble and illustrious Ruler Ozma of Oz that the wife and ten childrenf
