as he clambered to a seat on the sofas and assisted the Pumpkinhead to follow him In the South Country rules a very delightful Queen called Glinda the Good who I am sure will gladly receive us said the Scarecrow getting into the Thing clumsily Let us go to her and ask her advice That is cleverly thought of declared Nick Chopper giving the WoggleBug a boost and then toppling the SawHorse into the rear end of the cushioned seats I know Glinda the Good and believe she will prove a friend indeed Are we all ready asked the boy Yes announced the Tin Woodman seating himself beside the Scarecrow Then said Tip addressing the Gump be kind enough to fly with us to the Southward and do not go higher than to escape the houses and trees for it makes me dizzy to be up so far All right answered the Gump briefly 205 It flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air and then while our little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of the sofas for support the Gump turned toward the South and soared swiftly and majestically away The scenic effect from this altitude is marvelous commented the educated WoggleBug as they rode along Never mind the scenery said the Scarecrow Hold on tight or you may get a tumble The Thing seems to rock badly It will be dark soon said Tip observing that the sun was low on the horizon Perhaps we should have waited until morning I wonder if the Gump can fly in the night Ive been wondering that myself returned the Gump quietly You see this is a new experience to me I used to have legs that carried me swiftly over the ground But now my legs feel as if they were asleep They are said Tip We didnt bring em to life Youre expected to fly explained the Scarecrow not to walk We can walk ourselves said the WoggleBug I begin to understand what is required of me remarked the Gump so I will do my best to 206 please you and he flew on for a time in silence Presently Jack Pumpkinhead became uneasy I wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins he said Not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side answered the WoggleBug In that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin for it would become a squash Have I not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes demanded Tip looking at the WoggleBug with a severe expression You have and Ive restrained a good many of them replied the insect But there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in our language that to an educated person like myself the temptation to express them is almost irresistible People with more or less education discovered those puns centuries ago said Tip Are you sure asked the WoggleBug with a startled look Of course I am answered the boy An educated WoggleBug may be a new thing but a WoggleBug education is as old as the hills judging from the display you make of it The insect seemed much impressed by this remark and for a time maintained a meek silence 207 The Scarecrow in shifting his seat saw upon the cushions the pepperbox which Tip had cast aside and began to examine it Throw it overboard said the boy its quite empty now and theres no use keeping it Is it really empty asked the Scarecrow looking curiously into the box Of course it is answered Tip I shook out every grain of the powder Then the box has two bottoms announced the Scarecrow for the bottom on the inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the outside Let me see said the Tin Woodman taking the box from his friend Yes he declared after looking it over the thing certainly has a false bottom Now I wonder what that is for Cant you get it apart and find out enquired Tip now quite interested in the mystery Why yes the lower bottom unscrews said the Tin Woodman My fingers are rather stiff please see if you can open it He handed the pepperbox to Tip who had no difficulty in unscrewing the bottom And in the cavity below were three silver pills with a carefully folded paper lying underneath them This paper the boy proceeded to unfold taking 208 care not to spill the pills and found several lines clearly written in red ink Read it aloud said the Scarecrow so Tip read as follows DR NIKIDIKS CELEBRATED WISHING PILLS Directions for Use Swallow one pill count seventeen by twos then make a Wish The Wish will immediately be granted CAUTION Keep in a Dry and Dark Place Why this is a very valuable discovery cried the Scarecrow It is indeed replied Tip gravely These pills may be of great use to us I wonder if old Mombi knew they were in the bottom of the pepperbox I remember hearing her say that she got the Powder of Life from this same Nikidik He must be a powerful Sorcerer exclaimed the Tin Woodman and since the powder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the pills But how asked the Scarecrow can anyone count seventeen by twos Seventeen is an odd number That is true replied Tip greatly disappointed No one can possibly count seventeen by twos Then the pills are of no use to us wailed the Pumpkinhead and this fact overwhelms me with 209 grief Fo
