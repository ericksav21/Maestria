discovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese he had provided for the Journey had all been eaten While wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl sitting by the roadside She wore a costume that struck the boy as being remarkably brilliant her silken waist being of emerald green and her skirt of four distinct colorsblue in front yellow at the left side red at the back and purple at the right side Fastening 84 the waist in front were four buttonsthe top one blue the next yellow a third red and the last purple LineArt Drawing The splendor of this dress was almost barbaric so Tip was fully justified in staring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were attracted by the 85 pretty face above it Yes the face was pretty enough he decided but it wore an expression of discontent coupled to a shade of defiance or audacity While the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly A lunch basket stood beside her and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a hardboiled egg in the other eating with an evident appetite that aroused Tips sympathy He was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up and brushed the crumbs from her lap There said she it is time for me to go Carry that basket for me and help yourself to its contents if you are hungry Tip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat following for a time the strange girl without bothering to ask questions She walked along before him with swift strides and there was about her an air of decision and importance that led him to suspect she was some great personage Finally when he had satisfied his hunger he ran up beside her and tried to keep pace with her swift footstepsa very difficult feat for she was much taller than he and evidently in a hurry Thank you very much for the sandwiches said Tip as he trotted along May I ask your name 86 I am General Jinjur was the brief reply Oh said the boy surprised What sort of a General I command the Army of Revolt in this war answered the General with unnecessary sharpness Oh he again exclaimed I didnt know there was a war You were not supposed to know it she returned for we have kept it a secret and considering that our army is composed entirely of girls she added with some pride it is surely a remarkable thing that our Revolt is not yet discovered It is indeed acknowledged Tip But where is your army About a mile from here said General Jinjur The forces have assembled from all parts of the Land of Oz at my express command For this is the day we are to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow and wrest from him the throne The Army of Revolt only awaits my coming to march upon the Emerald City Well declared Tip drawing a long breath this is certainly a surprising thing May I ask why you wish to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow Because the Emerald City has been ruled by men long enough for one reason said the girl 87 Moreover the City glitters with beautiful gems which might far better be used for rings bracelets and necklaces and there is enough money in the Kings treasury to buy every girl in our Army a dozen new gowns So we intend to conquer the City and run the government to suit ourselves Jinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she was in earnest But war is a terrible thing said Tip thoughtfully This war will be pleasant replied the girl cheerfully Many of you will be slain continued the boy in an awed voice Oh no said Jinjur What man would oppose a girl or dare to harm her And there is not an ugly face in my entire Army Tip laughed Perhaps you are right said he But the Guardian of the Gate is considered a faithful Guardian and the Kings Army will not let the City be conquered without a struggle The Army is old and feeble replied General Jinjur scornfully His strength has all been used to grow whiskers and his wife has such a temper that she has already pulled more than half of them 88 out by the roots When the Wonderful Wizard reigned the Soldier with the Green Whiskers was a very good Royal Army for people feared the Wizard But no one is afraid of the Scarecrow so his Royal Army dont count for much in time of war After this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence and before long reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four hundred young women were assembled These were laughing and talking together as gaily as if they had gathered for a picnic instead of a war of conquest They were divided into four companies and Tip noticed that all were dressed in costumes similar to that worn by General Jinjur The only real difference was that while those girls from the Munchkin country had the blue strip in front of their skirts those from the country of the Quadlings had the red strip in front and those from the country of the Winkies had the yellow strip in front and the Gillikin girls wore the purple strip in front All had green waists representing the Emerald City they intended to conquer and the top button on each waist indicated
