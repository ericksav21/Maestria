 in the foremast The Read Bird did not trust Ato who was supposed to be on watch Besides he wanted to be the first to report a new island to the Captain Looks like a mountain mumbled Ato setting down his potatoes and waddling over to the rail Heave to Skipper heres our first discovery Now how in sixes did that get by me muttered Samuel Salt hurrying to shorten sail for the zigzag course back and in he would have to take to reach the island at all It showed plainly enough now a rugged gray and purple mass of rock with apparently no vegetation or dwellings of any kind As the Crescent Moon drew nearer the sea became smooth and oily and the air sulphurous and hot Think likely this is an island we might well pass by murmured Ato peering critically through his telescope Positively deserted so far as I can see C4 but there might be valuable minerals in those rocks Dont doubt it Samuel Salt curved himself all the way round the wheel in his interest Mechanical devices were well enough for the open sea but Samuel preferred to handle his own ship on occasions like this As there was no harbor or safe place to put in he decided to anchor offshore and land in the jolly boat The anchor had just gone clanking and rattling over the side when a horrid hiss and boom from the center of the island made all hands look up in alarm Kkkk cannons quavered Ato dropping his bread knife with a clatter Stand by to man the guns But Samuel Salt instead of heeding the cooks warning began to sniff the air Volcano Mates announced the Captain calmly And in that case we may be a bit close for comfort Still Ive always wanted to observe a volcano in action Ive a theory there may be living creatures in the center Living creatures in the center raged Ato tearing off his white apron and dashing it on the deck How long will we be living if that fire pot starts boiling We maynt be killed being of magic birth but we can be jolly well singed fried boiled and melted And after that whod care to be alive Quick Roger heave in on that chain Anchors aweigh While Samuel stood in rapt contemplation of the volcano and Ato began frantically winding up the anchor a long tongue of flame leaped out of the crater and a great jet of bubbling lava shot clear over the Crescent Moon This occurrence soon brought Samuel out of his reverie and snapping into action and forgetting all about his mechanical devices he began working like a madman to get the ship in motion tugging at the sheets throwing his whole weight against the halyards till the ship with quivering sail sped away like a frightened bird the hot winds from the volcano whistling and rattling through her rigging Wheres Roger yelled Ato staggering across the deck with two buckets of water Oh woe Is he a Read Bird or a just plain Goose Look yonder Sammy hes flown ashore Outlined against the sky in a sudden flare from the volcano they could see Roger poised over the center of the smoking island In his claw was a large rippling banner of Oz and as they looked he lifted the banner high above his head and flung it straight into the center of the boiling crater We hereby take complete and absolute possession of this island and declare all its inhabitants lawful subjects of her Majesty Queen Ozma of Oz screamed Roger hysterically Well hurray and three cheers for a real Explorer shouted Samuel Salt Hes done it all by himself the only man among us who remembered his duty under fire Theres a bird for you Mates Not even a volcano can turn him from his duty All we thought of was safety Pah Rubbing the back of his hand across his eyes which were full of smoke Samuel looked glumly across at his cook Now now dont be too hard on yourself puffed the King setting down the fire buckets A Captain must think of his ship even if he is an Explorer Besides having wings gives Roger an advantage of us Still and all it was a brave and timely act Atos further remarks were drowned out in a second tremendous explosion Sky and sea turned red whole flaming boulders shot above the ships spars while great sullen waves of lava boiled over the craters edge and rolled smoking and hissing into the sea Missed us again panted Samuel Salt hanging desperately to his wheel as the Crescent Moon plunged and pitched in the angry sea Wonder what started that The Oz flag probably gasped Ato feeling around in the dense smoke for his fire buckets Hope Roger got off safely Where is that fool bird Ho Sammy Hi Sammy Quick theyve hit us amidships Hastily setting his mechanical steering gear the former Pirate rushed forward to where a glowing lump of lava was burning its way slowly but surely through the deck Fire Fire shrilled Roger who had dropped down on the rail unnoticed in the smoke and confusion Water Ato Water you old Slowpoke Avast puffed Samuel Salt staring down in astonishment at the glowing lump at his feet Its alive Mates and lively as a grig Its a FIRE baby thats what HAH Didnt I just say there was life on a volcano Well this proves it and Im taking thi
