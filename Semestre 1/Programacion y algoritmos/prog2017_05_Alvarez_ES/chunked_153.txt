in I suppose the vegetable folk were always afraid to enter this cavern because it is dark but we have our lanterns to light the way so I propose that we start out and discover where this tunnel in the mountain leads to The others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion and at once the boy began to harness Jim to the buggy When all was in readiness the three took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along the way Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted lantern so the horse could see where to go Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed the sides then it would broaden out as wide as a street but the floor was usually smooth and for a long time they travelled on without any accident Jim stopped sometimes to rest for the climb was rather steep and tiresome We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns by this time said Dorothy I didnt know this mountain was so tall We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos added Zeb for we have slanted away from it ever since we started But they kept steadily moving and just as Jim was about tired out with his long journey the way suddenly grew lighter and Zeb put out the lanterns to save the oil To their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them for all were weary of the colored rainbow lights which after a time had made their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays The sides of the tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spyglass and the floor became more level Jim hastened his lagging steps at this assurance of a quick relief from the dark passage and in a few moments more they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to face with a new and charming country 8 The Valley of Voices By journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful valley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup with another rugged mountain showing on the other side of it and soft and pretty green hills at the ends It was all laid out into lovely lawns and gardens with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there There were orchards too bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our world Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their flowerstrewn banks while scattered over the valley were dozens of the quaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld None of them were in clusters such as villages or towns but each had ample grounds of its own with orchards and gardens surrounding it As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enraptured by its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air which they breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed two very singular and unusual facts about this valley One was that it was lighted from some unseen source for no sun or moon was in the arched blue sky although every object was flooded with a clear and perfect light The second and even more singular fact was the absence of any inhabitant of this splendid place From their elevated position they could overlook the entire valley but not a single moving object could they see All appeared mysteriously deserted The mountain on this side was not glass but made of a stone similar to granite With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over the loose rocks until he reached the green lawns below where the paths and orchards and gardens began The nearest cottage was still some distance away Isnt it fine cried Dorothy in a joyous voice as she sprang out of the buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass Yes indeed answered Zeb We were lucky to get away from those dreadful vegetable people It wouldnt be so bad remarked the Wizard gazing around him if we were obliged to live here always We couldnt find a prettier place Im sure He took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass and Jim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very contented in his new surroundings We cant walk in the air here though called Eureka who had tried it and failed but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground and the Wizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth then they had been in the Mangaboo country for everything was more homelike and natural But where are the people asked Dorothy The little man shook his bald head Cant imagine my dear he replied They heard the sudden twittering of a bird but could not find the creature anywhere Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearest cottage the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausing at every step for another mouthful of grass Presently they came to a low plant which had broad spreading leaves in the center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach The fruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant and look
