nce if she were sitting on the throne of this singular airtry Even thinking of the gentle and dignified little Girl Ruler of Oz steadied Jellia Holding her head very high she stepped down from the dais and began pacing slowly up and down the pavilion switching her green skirts in such a regal manner that the two messengers who had returned quietly to their posts stared at her with new interest and admiration Is there anything we might bring your Stratjesty asked Junnenrump bowing from the waist and clicking his heels smartly together At his question Jellia paused and eyed the two speculatively Why yes she decided after a moments thought You Junnenrump may send someone to amuse me and you Hippenscop may bring me two of those winged staffs It is neither safe nor proper for a Starina and her Army to be without them But your Skyness Hippenscop leaped into the air and spun round and round in an agony of embarrassment There are no extra staffs he blurted finally coming to a stop before her The little fellow looked so distressed Jellia was on the point of letting him off Then remembering just in time that she was bound to be obeyed she raised her arm Go she commanded haughtily And do not return without two winged staffs Junnenrump already had started and at Jellias stern command Hippenscop backed dejectedly down the steps his eyes bulging with dismay and consternation If Wanny and I had flying sticks wed at least be as well off as the rest of these Airlanders reasoned Jellia resuming her walk But what funny names she mused as the messengers disappeared in two different directions and at two different speeds They make me think ofFF20C4 Here Jellia took a little run and jump following it with a skip and a hop I suppose she continued talking conversationally to herself that is what their names really mean everything is so mixed up here Regaining her throne in one long slide Jellia brought up with a slight start This she decided was no way for a Starina to act Smoothing down her dress she walked sedately to Struts throne and reached underneath The real reason she had got rid of the messengers of course was so she could recover the kitbag and have a chance to examine its contents without being observed The cheer gas had saved them on one occasion and perhaps there was magic powerful enough to enable her and the Soldier to escape from the airosphere before Strut returned The bag was still there and snatching it up in her arms Jellia climbed back on the throne But just as she was about to zip it open Junnenrump bounded up the steps of the pavilion dragging a lean old Skylander by the hand His Majestys Piper announced Junnenrump giving the Piper a shove forward and seating himself expectantly on the messengers bench Jellia was annoyed to have Junnenrump return so soon But since she had sent for someone to amuse her she could not very well object So resting her chin in her hand she looked curiously at the Royal Piper The old Skylander was tremendously tall and thin His tunic was short and plaited and under his arms he carried a pair of enormous bagpipes Jellia had never cared for bagpipes but on an airosphere she supposed wind instruments such as this naturally would be popular The Piper however did not immediately play on his pipes Instead he struck a few light and pleasant chords on the top buttons of his tunic Shall I do a buck and wing or a little Skyland fling Shall I sing a little sing for you Dear bawled the Piper cheerfully He looked so funny that Jellia burst out laughing Thus encouraged the Piper proceeded to sing punctuating his song with extraordinary leaps and toe tappings When we Skylanders feel low we just Dance the stratispho Step it high kick and fly toss the Partner up skihigh High HO Would you care to try it he asked politely holding out his hand to Jellia No No Not today gasped the Oz maid backing as far as the star throne would allow But Ive really enjoyed watching you very much and your singing is lovely she added generously Ah but wait until you hear me play puffed the Piper Raising his pipes he blew forth such a hurricane of whistles squeals and fierce thunderings that poor Jellia clapped both hands to her ears Tell him to go away she screamed above the awful din wildly motioning to Junnenrump who was tapping his foot in time to the pipes and looking highly diverted Tell him to come back tomorrow The fierce music of the bagpipes had brought airlanders running from every direction Crowding round the pavilion they waved and bowed to the new Starina Realizing she never would have any privacy under the Imperial Canopy Jellia slipped off her throne The messenger had the Piper by the tunic tails and was easing him gently down the steps Jellia waited till they reached the bottom then as all the airlanders began to run after the still furiously pumping piper Jellia started in the opposite direction Surely somewhere she thought clutching the kitbag close to her somewhere she could find a quiet corner or cave
