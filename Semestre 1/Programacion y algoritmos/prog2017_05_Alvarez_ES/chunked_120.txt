King had instructed her to do when she guessed But the candelabra remained as it was before Then she wandered into another room and touched a china lamb thinking it might be one of the children she sought But again she was unsuccessful Three guesses four guesses five six seven eight nine and ten she made and still not one of them was right The girl shivered a little and grew pale even under the rosy light for now but one guess remained and her own fate depended upon the result She resolved not to be hasty and strolled through all the rooms once more gazing earnestly upon the various ornaments and trying to decide which she would touch Finally in despair she decided to leave it entirely to chance She faced the doorway of a room shut her eyes tightly and then thrusting aside the heavy draperies she advanced blindly with her right arm outstretched before her Slowly softly she crept forward until her hand came in contact with an object upon a small round table She did not know what it was but in a low voice she pronounced the word Ev The rooms were quite empty of life after that The Nome King had gained a new ornament For upon the edge of the table rested a pretty grasshopper that seemed to have been formed from a single emerald It was all that remained of Ozma of Oz In the throne room just beyond the palace the Nome King suddenly looked up and smiled Next he said in his pleasant voice Dorothy the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman who had been sitting in anxious silence each gave a start of dismay and stared into one anothers eyes Has she failed asked Tiktok So it seems answered the little monarch cheerfully But that is no reason one of you should not succeed The next may have twelve guesses instead of eleven for there are now twelve persons transformed into ornaments Well well Which of you goes next Ill go said Dorothy Not so replied the Tin Woodman As commander of Ozmas army it is my privilege to follow her and attempt her rescue Away you go then said the Scarecrow But be careful old friend I will promised the Tin Woodman and then he followed the Nome King to the entrance to the palace and the rock closed behind him 13 The Nome King Laughs In a moment the King returned to his throne and relighted his pipe and the rest of the little band of adventurers settled themselves for another long wait They were greatly disheartened by the failure of their girl Ruler and the knowledge that she was now an ornament in the Nome Kings palacea dreadful creepy place in spite of all its magnificence Without their little leader they did not know what to do next and each one down to the trembling private of the army began to fear he would soon be more ornamental than useful Suddenly the Nome King began laughing Ha ha ha He he he Ho ho ho Whats happened asked the Scarecrow Why your friend the Tin Woodman has become the funniest thing you can imagine replied the King wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes No one would ever believe he could make such an amusing ornament Next They gazed at each other with sinking hearts One of the generals began to weep dolefully What are you crying for asked the Scarecrow indignant at such a display of weakness He owed me six weeks back pay said the general and I hate to lose him Then you shall go and find him declared the Scarecrow Me cried the general greatly alarmed Certainly It is your duty to follow your commander March I wont said the general Id like to of course but I just simply WONT The Scarecrow looked enquiringly at the Nome King Never mind said the jolly monarch If he doesnt care to enter the palace and make his guesses Ill throw him into one of my fiery furnaces Ill goof course Im going yelled the general as quick as scat Where is the entrancewhere is it Let me go at once So the Nome King escorted him into the palace and again returned to await the result What the general did no one can tell but it was not long before the King called for the next victim and a colonel was forced to try his fortune Thus one after another all of the twentysix officers filed into the palace and made their guessesand became ornaments Meantime the King ordered refreshments to be served to those waiting and at his command a rudely shaped Nome entered bearing a tray This Nome was not unlike the others that Dorothy had seen but he wore a heavy gold chain around his neck to show that he was the Chief Steward of the Nome King and he assumed an air of much importance and even told his majesty not to eat too much cake late at night or he would be ill Dorothy however was hungry and she was not afraid of being ill so she ate several cakes and found them good and also she drank a cup of excellent coffee made of a richly flavored clay browned in the furnaces and then ground fine and found it most refreshing and not at all muddy Of all the party which had started upon this adventure the little Kansas girl was now left alone with the Scarecrow Tiktok and the private for counsellors and companions Of course the Cowardly
