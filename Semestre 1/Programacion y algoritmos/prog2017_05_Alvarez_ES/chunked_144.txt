his people flocked out of the hall into the street that they might see what was about to happen Dorothy and Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them but the Sorcerer remained calmly in his throne Far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon It was not so high as the glowing star of the six colored suns but was descending slowly through the airso slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to move The throng stood still and waited It was all they could do for to go away and leave that strange sight was impossible nor could they hurry its fall in any way The earth children were not noticed being so near the average size of the Mangaboos and the horse had remained in the House of the Sorcerer with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of the buggy Gradually the balloon grew bigger which was proof that it was settling down upon the Land of the Mangaboos Dorothy was surprised to find how patient the people were for her own little heart was beating rapidly with excitement A balloon meant to her some other arrival from the surface of the earth and she hoped it would be some one able to assist her and Zeb out of their difficulties In an hour the balloon had come near enough for her to see a basket suspended below it in two hours she could see a head looking over the side of the basket in three hours the big balloon settled slowly into the great square in which they stood and came to rest on the glass pavement Then a little man jumped out of the basket took off his tall hat and bowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him He was quite an old little man and his head was long and entirely bald Why cried Dorothy in amazement its Oz The little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she was But he smiled and bowed as he answered Yes my dear I am Oz the Great and Terrible Eh And you are little Dorothy from Kansas I remember you very well Who did you say it was whispered Zeb to the girl Its the wonderful Wizard of Oz Havent you heard of him Just then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard Sir said he why are you here in the Land of the Mangaboos Didnt know what land it was my son returned the other with a pleasant smile and to be honest I didnt mean to visit you when I started out I live on top of the earth your honor which is far better than living inside it but yesterday I went up in a balloon and when I came down I fell into a big crack in the earth caused by an earthquake I had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not rise again and in a few minutes the earth closed over my head So I continued to descend until I reached this place and if you will show me a way to get out of it Ill go with pleasure Sorry to have troubled you but it couldnt be helped The Prince had listened with attention Said he This child who is from the crust of the earth like yourself called you a Wizard Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer Its better replied Oz promptly One Wizard is worth three Sorcerers Ah you shall prove that said the Prince We Mangaboos have at the present time one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was picked from a bush but he sometimes makes mistakes Do you ever make mistakes Never declared the Wizard boldly Oh Oz said Dorothy you made a lot of mistakes when you were in the marvelous Land of Oz Nonsense said the little man turning redalthough just then a ray of violet sunlight was on his round face Come with me said the Prince to him I wish to meet our Sorcerer The Wizard did not like this invitation but he could not refuse to accept it So he followed the Prince into the great domed hall and Dorothy and Zeb came after them while the throng of people trooped in also There sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state and when the Wizard saw him he began to laugh uttering comical little chuckles What an absurd creature he exclaimed He may look absurd said the Prince in his quiet voice but he is an excellent Sorcerer The only fault I find with him is that he is so often wrong I am never wrong answered the Sorcerer Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of Stones or of People said the Prince Well what then Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong One person cannot be called people said the Sorcerer If two should come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong but unless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right Very clever said the Wizard nodding his head as if pleased I am delighted to find humbugs inside the earth just the same as on top of it Were you ever with a circus brother No said the Sorcerer You ought to join one declared the little man seriously I belong to Bailum Barneys Great Consolidated Showsthree rings in one tent and a menagerie on the side Its a fine aggregation I assure you What do you do asked the Sorcerer I go up in a balloon usually to draw the crowds to the circus But Ive just had the bad luck to come out of the sky skip the solid earth and land lower
