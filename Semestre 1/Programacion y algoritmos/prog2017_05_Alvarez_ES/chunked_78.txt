et in depth Above them was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock where the wrecked body of the Gump still hung suspended from the end of one of the sofas There really seemed to be no means of escape and as they realized their helpless plight the little band of adventurers gave way to their bewilderment This is a worse prison than the palace sadly remarked the WoggleBug I wish we had stayed there moaned Jack 215 Im afraid the mountain air isnt good for pumpkins It wont be when the Jackdaws come back growled the SawHorse which lay waving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet again Jackdaws are especially fond of pumpkins Do you think the birds will come here asked Jack much distressed Of course they will said Tip for this is their nest And there must be hundreds of them he continued for see what a lot of things they have brought here Indeed the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of small articles for which the birds could have no use but which the thieving Jackdaws had stolen during many years from the homes of men And as the nest was safely hidden where no human being could reach it this lost property would never be recovered The WoggleBug searching among the rubbishfor the Jackdaws stole useless things as well as valuable onesturned up with his foot a beautiful diamond necklace This was so greatly admired by the Tin Woodman that the WoggleBug presented it to him with a graceful speech after which the Woodman hung it around his neck with much pride 216 Full page lineart drawing TURNED UP A BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND NECKLACE 217 rejoicing exceedingly when the big diamonds glittered in the suns rays But now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings and as the sound grew nearer to them Tip exclaimed The Jackdaws are coming And if they find us here they will surely kill us in their anger I was afraid of this moaned the Pumpkinhead My time has come And mine also said the WoggleBug for Jackdaws are the greatest enemies of my race The others were not at all afraid but the Scarecrow at once decided to save those of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds So he commanded Tip to take off Jacks head and lie down with it in the bottom of the nest and when this was done he ordered the WoggleBug to lie beside Tip Nick Chopper who knew from past experience Just what to do then took the Scarecrow to pieces all except his head and scattered the straw over Tip and the WoggleBug completely covering their bodies Hardly had this been accomplished when the flock of Jackdaws reached them Perceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon them with screams of rage 218 Full page lineart drawing 219 Dr Nikidiks Famous Wishing Pills The Tin Woodman was usually a peaceful man but when occasion required he could fight as fiercely as a Roman gladiator So when the Jackdaws nearly knocked him down in their rush of wings and their sharp beaks and claws threatened to damage his brilliant plating the Woodman picked up his axe and made it whirl swiftly around his head But although many were beaten off in this way the birds were so numerous and so brave that they continued the attack as furiously as before Some of them pecked at the eyes of the Gump which hung over the nest in a helpless condition but the Gumps eyes were of glass and could not be injured Others of the Jackdaws rushed at the SawHorse but that animal being still upon his back kicked out so viciously with his wooden legs that he beat off as many assailants as did the Woodmans axe 220 Finding themselves thus opposed the birds fell upon the Scarecrows straw which lay at the center of the nest covering Tip and the WoggleBug and Jacks pumpkin head and began tearing it away and flying off with it only to let it drop straw by straw into the great gulf beneath The Scarecrows head noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his interior cried to the Tin Woodman to save him and that good friend responded with renewed energy His axe fairly flashed among the Jackdaws and fortunately the Gump began wildly waving the two wings remaining on the left side of its body The flutter of these great wings filled the Jackdaws with terror and when the Gump by its exertions freed itself from the peg of rock on which it hung and sank flopping into the nest the alarm of the birds knew no bounds and they fled screaming over the mountains When the last foe had disappeared Tip crawled from under the sofas and assisted the WoggleBug to follow him We are saved shouted the boy delightedly We are indeed responded the Educated Insect fairly hugging the stiff head of the Gump in his joy and we owe it all to the flopping of the Thing and the good axe of the Woodman 221 If I am saved get me out of here called Jack whose head was still beneath the sofas and Tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it upon its neck again He also set the SawHorse upright and said to it We owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made I really think we h
