hing and biting furiously and the kitten ruined so many vegetable complexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long They tired Jim and Eureka out and although the field of battle was thickly covered with mashed and disabled Mangaboos our animal friends had to give up at last and allow themselves to be driven to the mountain 7 Into the Black Pit and Out Again When they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged towering chunk of deep green glass and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme Half way up the steep was a yawning cave black as night beyond the point where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it The Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into this dark hole and then having pushed the buggy in after themfor it seemed some of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hallthey began to pile big glass rocks within the entrance so that the prisoners could not get out again This is dreadful groaned Jim It will be about the end of our adventures I guess If the Wizard was here said one of the piglets sobbing bitterly he would not see us suffer so We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked added Eureka But never mind be brave my friends and I will go and tell our masters where you are and get them to come to your rescue The mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now but the kitten gave a leap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the air The Mangaboos saw her escape and several of them caught up their thorns and gave chase mounting through the air after her Eureka however was lighter than the Mangaboos and while they could mount only about a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could go nearly two hundred feet So she ran along over their heads until she had left them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House of the Sorcerer There she entered in at Dorothys window in the dome and aroused her from her sleep As soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the Wizard and Zeb and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue of Jim and the piglets The Wizard carried his satchel which was quite heavy and Zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can Dorothys wicker suitcase was still under the seat of the buggy and by good fortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he had taken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest So there was nothing for the girl to carry but the kitten which she held close to her bosom and tried to comfort for its little heart was still beating rapidly Some of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House of the Sorcerer but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable people allowed them to proceed without interference yet followed in a crowd behind them so that they could not go back again Before long they neared the Black Pit where a busy swarm of Mangaboos headed by their Princess was engaged in piling up glass rocks before the entrance Stop I command you cried the Wizard in an angry tone and at once began pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets Instead of opposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a goodsized hole in the barrier when by order of the Princess they all sprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns Dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked and Zeb and the Wizard after enduring a few stabs from the thorns were glad to follow her At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass again and as the little man realized that they were all about to be entombed in the mountain he said to the children My dears what shall we do Jump out and fight Whats the use replied Dorothy Id as soon die here as live much longer among these cruel and heartless people Thats the way I feel about it remarked Zeb rubbing his wounds Ive had enough of the Mangaboos All right said the Wizard Im with you whatever you decide But we cant live long in this cavern thats certain Noticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets patted each one lovingly on its fat little head and placed them carefully in his inside pocket Zeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns The rays of the colored suns were now shut out from them forever for the last chinks had been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the Land of the Mangaboos How big is this hole asked Dorothy Ill explore it and see replied the boy So he carried the lantern back for quite a distance while Dorothy and the Wizard followed at his side The cavern did not come to an end as they had expected it would but slanted upward through the great glass mountain running in a direction that promised to lead them to the side opposite the Mangaboo country It isnt a bad road observed the Wizard and if we followed it it might lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black pocket we are now
