turn the belt to me Oh naturally promised the wizard chuckling to himself as he thought how quickly he would turn Ruggedo to a rock once he was wearing the famous belt Taking a glass of melted silver from the tray the boy had just set down Wutz lifted it to his lips and Ruggedo his eyes glittering with all their old spitefulness raised his own glass to drink to the wicked bargain Come he sputtered wiping his mouth on the back of his hand When do we start What magic have you to carry us to the capital and open the emerald safe where the magic belt and other important treasures of Ozma are hidden But wait perhaps we had better look in the magic picture and see where Ozma and the Wizard of Oz are now I am afraid we cannot do that Wutz explained regretfully Seven spoiled the canvas in some way when he reduced it to carry it here It doesnt show anything now and Ive not had time to repair the damage Pshaw thats too bad said Ruggedo going over to touch the picture now hanging on the wizards wall But the record book is still working I suppose Oh yes said the wizard stepping up to the marble table and glancing down at the open page And listen to this It says roared the Silver King holding his sides and simply rocking with wicked merriment it says The two metal monarchs are plotting the downfall of the present ruler of OzFF20 What else does it say inquired the Gnome King who had more experience than his companion in dealing with the magicians of the Emerald City It says Ozma and her counselors have gone to the castle of Glinda the Good Wutz told him complacently closing and padlocking the big volume Then wed better start at once and before they return declared Ruggedo For as soon as we have my belt we can change them to rocks wherever they are The most important thing is to get that belt before they know we are after it But how are we going to get to the Emerald City and howre we going to open that safe My silver blowpipe will reduce the safe to a heap of ashes without injuring the contents answered the wizard and reaching the capital will be the simplest part of all Taking a silver tube from a high shelf Wutz put it in his pocket and reaching for his bubble pipe he began to blow an enormous quicksilver bubble round himself and the Gnome King Slowly and with both Kings inside the bubble rose passed in a silver mist out of the wizards den up through the honeycomb of caves caverns and grottos on 20up and up till it floated right out of the top of the Silver Kings Mountain CHAPTER 19 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN At the same moment the silver bubble carrying Wutz and Ruggedo burst out of the top of the mountain Handy Mandy and Nox reached the bottom arriving at last at the end of the winding stair One amethyst burned dimly on the small landing and crowded uncomfortably together the two prisoners found themselves facing a heavily barred door Private Lower of the Wizard of Wutz Keep Out announced a surly sign But Handy and Nox their legs still quivering from the long downward climb were in no humor to be stopped by a sign Lower sniffed Handy Mandy disgustedly I should think it was We must be at the very bottom of this miserable mountain Lower indeed Well I expect a lower is the opposite of a tower Come on Picking up the silver ball Handy squinted sharply at the door giving it a quick shove to see whether it was locked or fitted with an invisible moving panel But there was nothing remarkable about this door and nothing on it except a very small silver keyhole which at once recalled to the Goat Girl the key she had been carrying around ever since she left Keretaria Oh Nox I believe the key in your horn will fit she cried excitedly and deftly removing the left prong of Noxs headgear she shook out the ball Then while Nox fairly panting with impatience looked on Handy took the key from the ball and inserted it in the silver lock When it turned easily and smoothly she was almost afraid to open the door What would they find on the other side What had the wizard done to his helpless young captive As Handy hesitated Nox rushed forward banging the door open with his great shoulder Kerry Kerry wailed the faithful Ox and falling to his knees Nox began to snort and blubber in real earnest Handy hurrying after him into the small stuffy cell saw a handsome boy in hunting costume standing motionless and silent as a statue in the center of a great shimmering violet bubble Without thinking or reasoning or even stopping to consult the Ox the Goat Girl flung out all of her arms toward the solitary figure her iron hand puncturing the bubble with a deafening pop Why hello Nox The Little King stepped calmly out of the misty vapor all that was left of the wizards bubble Wheres your other horn And who is this jollylooking girl WHO indeed There was so much to be told and explained even with Handy and Nox talking as fast as they could and taking turns it took almost an hour to tell the story of their journey from Keretaria to the Silver Mountain an
