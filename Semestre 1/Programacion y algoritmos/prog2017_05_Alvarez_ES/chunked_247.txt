seat at the foot of the table and running her eye hurriedly down the glittering board Dorothy saw five more empty places Pressing a finger to her forehead Dorothy tried to remember who had been sitting in the five deserted chairs Surely Joe King and Queen Hyacinth had been there between Bettsy Bobbin and Trot while Prince Philador Queen Orin and King Cheeriobed had been directly opposite Good Gillikens gasped the little girl jumping quickly to her feet The rulers of all four Oz countries are gone and Highboys gone too And strangely enough nobody seemed to have missed them Instead they were listening with broad smiles and appreciatively tapping toes to the loud and hilarious singing of the Patch Work Girl Scraps thinking it a shame to let a mere change of whiskers spoil a good party was enlivening the company with her newest and most comical rhymes So loud was her voice and the applause of the banqueters Dorothy found it impossible to make herself heard so running around to the back of the Scarecrows chair she tugged him anxiously by the arm Scarecrow Scarecrow whispered Dorothy hoarsely Where are the Four Rulers of Oz and whatever can be keeping the Wizard so long Tearing his gaze reluctantly from the Patch Work Girl the Scarecrow looked dreamily over his shoulder WHAT WIZARD he inquired blankly THE Wizard OUR Wizard the wonderful Wizard of Oz Dorothy stamped her foot and almost shouted with surprise and vexation Never heard of him declared the Scarecrow smiling blandly down at her Now why not sit quietly down and listen to Scraps Shes never been funnier Ha Ha Ha Never funnier Dorothy was so stunned and dumbfounded by the Scarecrows statement about the Wizard she opened and closed her mouth several times without saying anything Mercy Id better tell Ozma about this she thought distractedly and swinging round abruptly she scurried along back of the diners till she came to the head of the table Oh Ozma panted the little girl breathlessly C4 then stopped short There was no one in Ozmas great dragonarmed chair of state The Yellow Knight and Prince Pompadore who for the last course were in the seats of honor beside the little Queen leaned unconcernedly across her empty place engaged in a long earnest argument about horses They looked up in surprise as Dorothy her crown by this time very much on the side bounced suddenly between them Wheres Ozma demanded the little girl thumping her fist sharply on the table Ozma The Yellow Knight and Prince Pompa exchanged an uneasy glance Who is Ozma asked Prince Pompadore curiously Oh Oh I think you are all perfectly horrid Stop joking Stop teasing me cried Dorothy and as both Princes in frank amazement jumped up to try to comfort her she rushed angrily from the room As she fled along the green corridor she could still hear Scraps singing and the shouts and cheers of her listeners This is terrible terrible wailed Dorothy and running blindly down the long hall she burst through the swinging doors of the Wizards laboratory What she had expected to find Dorothy hardly knew Really she was hoping to see Ozma and the four other rulers grouped around the Wizards green table But only a blank suffocating silence answered her frantic calls for the Wizard Frightened into silence herself Dorothy tiptoed from one end of the other of the long curiously appointed apartment peering into cupboards under sofas and back of screens Where was the Red Jinn Where was the Little Wizard of Oz Not here certainly Not in the Banquet Hall But the THRONE ROOM THERE she would find all of her missing friends conferring with Ozma over the threatened danger to the realm With a little gasp of relief she darted across the corridor into the vast and magnificent Hall of Justice where Ozma received visitors settled disputes and carried on all the important business of governing They were not in the sumptuous presence chamber but at least the throne was not empty No no indeed Dorothy looked once rubbed her eyes looked again and then giving a shrill scream of terror flung both arms round one of the emeraldstudded pillars An immense white horse was sitting on the throne of Oz A great fat King was sitting on the horse or rather clinging desperately to his neck Dorothy knew he was a King by the crown perched ridiculously on the side of his head That crown seemed oddly familiar and after another horrified glance Dorothy screamed again for it was the splendid emerald circlet belonging to Ozma of Oz Her screams seemed to rouse the two occupants of the throne who to be perfectly frank looked as dazed and stupefied as Dorothy herself Go away sputtered the fat King waving his arms irritably Go away little girl and dont bother me And kindly bow as you leave directed the White Horse lifting one foot sternly You are looking at the Emperor of Oz and his Imperial Charger Bowing more from astonishment than intention Dorothy backed a few steps then turned round and ran madly toward the Royal Banquet Hall CHAPTER 8 WAY FOR THE EMPEROR
