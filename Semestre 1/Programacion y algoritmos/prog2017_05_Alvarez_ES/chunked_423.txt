strength as also did Wantowin but hustled along by the huge Skylanders they could do little to help themselves Relentlessly with the jeering citizens of Stratovania running along after them the unfortunate Oz pair was dragged on Just wait till your Master hears about this sobbed Jellia as the Blowmen shoved them as near to the edge of the cliffs as they dared go themselves Then they stepped back to lift their horns Jellia had managed to retain her hold on the Wizards kitbag but even so she felt that their last moment had come Jellia gave a final sad little wave to the Soldier who really was quite brave now that his doom had arrived The Blowmen pointed their horns straight at them but before they even could inflate their cheeks a fierce roar and splutter from the clouds caused every head to turn upwards The ship the ship The flying ship cried the First Blowman letting his horn fall disregarded to the ground Its Strut screamed the Stratovanians treading on one anothers toes in their sudden frenzy to be out of sight of their Master when he landed FF20Tis the Master himself cried the first Blowman yanking Jellia and the Soldier back from the edge of the Skyland Pulling Kabebe along with them the Blowmen ran as never before closely followed by Struts scurrying subjects One moment later there was not a single airbody in sight Convinced that their cruel and brilliant ruler had returned they ran like rabbits Some even flew helping themselves along with their winged staffs while Jellia sinking on a large crystal boulder stared dazedly at the silverbodied plane dropping rapidly toward them It cant be the Oztober cried Jellia delightedly It couldnt have come back so soon Its not cried Wantowin Battles tossing up his cap and waving his arms exuberantly Its the other one the Ozpril and that meansFF20C4 In his extreme excitement the Soldier tripped over a balloon bush and fell seven feet into the air It means the Wizard himself has come to help us sputtered Wantowin blinking rapidly as he landed hard on the rock beside the young Oz maid Three cheers Jellia The Wizard of Oz has saved us CHAPTER 10 THE WIZARD IN STRATOVANIA It was indeed the Ozpril just as the Soldier with Green Whiskers had said Even at a distance Jellia could spell out the name on the gleaming body and as the silvery plane came swooping toward them she could not repress a shout of joy Too exhausted by the dreadful ordeal she had just been through to run to meet the ship she jerked off her scarf and waved it wildly over her head About ten feet from the crystal boulder on which she had been sitting the Ozpril came to a gentle and perfect landing Scarcely had the whirr and sputter of its engine died away before the door of the cabin burst open and down climbed the little Wizard of Oz followed by Dorothy and the Scarecrow The Cowardly Lion last of all had difficulty fitting his paws on the rungs and after a trembling descent rolled over on his back his four feet straight up in the air The trip had not agreed with the Cowardly Lion at all Weak and dizzy he made no attempt to rise Here you are at last cried the Wizard happily rushing over to Jellia and seizing both of her hands So THIS is where youve been Well I must say its a fine place Why its beautiful beautiful Swinging round so he could look in all directions the Wizard positively glowed with interest and enthusiasm Whats so beautiful about it growled the lion without turning over Is there any grass Are there any trees Is there anything to eat Dorothy on the point of embracing Jellia gave a little scream for the Tellallescope which she had picked up just before leaving the plane was making terse announcements At this point it happened to be pointed at Jellia Clearing its throat it remarked in a superior way You are now looking at Miss Jellia Jam formerly of Oz at present new Starina of the Strat by edict of Strutoovious the Seventh Miss Jellia Jam Starina of Stratovania Period Stop drop or point elsewhere Why Jellia gasped Dorothy letting the Tellallescope fall with a crash Are you really Oh my I dont suppose youll ever want to return to Oz now Why you must be having a wonderful time Humph sniffed Jellia with a slightly wan smile If being pinched chased and nearly blown to atoms is having a wonderful time then I guess Ive been having it all right Tell me requested the Scarecrow who had been walking in a slow circle around Jellia Does one prostrate oneself before a Starina or does one merely kiss her hand Neither laughed Jellia Jumping up she gave the Scarecrow such a hug he was out of shape for hours But quick Lets all hop in the Ozpril and fly away before something terrible happens Fly away cried the Wizard shoving back his high hat But my dear weve only just come Ive been flying all night and need a little rest and refreshment before we start off again Besides I would like to see more of this interesting airland and its people and add to my data on the Strata Thats what Nick thought observed Jellia putt
