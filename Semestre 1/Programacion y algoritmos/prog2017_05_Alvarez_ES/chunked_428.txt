ness of their situation wore off Passing out of the moist clammy strata just below Struts Kingdom into a drier and lessclouded area the spirits of the little band of adventurers rose The wings of each flying staff though not large were powerful as airplane propellers and they flapped as rhythmically as the wings of a bird Not exactly like riding in an Ozoplane called the Wizard waving cheerfully to Jellia Still its better than falling eh Jellia who had maneuvered her staff to a position close to his nodded emphatically What worries me is the altitude she called back presently Somewhere or other we lost our air helmets Will the effects of those altitude pills wear off before were out of the strat No well be all right promised the Wizard My altitude pills condition one for the upper areas for several days at a time Oh Then everythings splendid sighed Jellia pushing back her curly locks and smiling at Dorothy Unless we meet a meteor and then our flight will soon be oer quavered the Scarecrow waving his arm in a doleful circle Now now dont anticipate advised the Wizard guiding the staff with one hand and opening his kit bag with the other For several moments he had been anxiously regarding the Cowardly Lion The buoyancy resulting from the wind pudding was at last subsiding and the swelled and bloated appearance of the unfortunate beast was fast disappearing At almost any time now the lion would become a dead weight His poundage added to the Wizards and the Soldiers would be too much for the flying staff and they all would plunge like plummets to the earth Feeling hurriedly around in the kitbag the Wizard pulled out a small black bottle Uncorking it with his teeth he turned it upside down and held it out at arms length until not a drop of its oily contents remained Now dont be alarmed at a sudden bump he warned as his companions watched him with surprise and curiosity Whatever happens hold on to your staff Scarcely had the Wizard issued his warning when the air directly beneath them froze into a solid block of blue ice on which they landed with a series of bumps and began sliding around in great confusion Nothing to worry about Nothing to worry about panted the Wizard keeping a firm hold on his flying stick and at the same time managing to extract a large envelope from the kitbag Hold on to that stick Jellia and keep it down The Cowardly Lion completely deflated by his smack against the ice was sprawled flat as an animal skin in the center of the berg Dismounting from his own staff the Wizard scurried perilously round the edges of the rapidly falling block of ice scattering seeds from his envelope with a lavish hand Instantly or so it seemed to Dorothy a thick green hedge sprang up enclosing them snugly inside To keep us from tumbling off explained the Wizard sliding anxiously after Wantowin Battles who was galloping round and round on his flying stick like a child on a merrygoround Whoa whoa cried Ozmas chief magician grabbing the Soldiers coattails We need these sticks to act as brakes to stop our fall Unseating the Soldier the Wizard lifted the flying stick and stuck it through the top branches of the hedge Bidding the others dismount from their staff he thrust it through the hedge on the opposite side The wings of both staffs kept up their steady beating and as the Wizard had predicted acted as strong brakes on the plunging cake of ice I was afraid wed lose our lion explained the Wizard as the little company of adventurers gathered breathlessly round him Id just as lief be lost as frozen Sneezing plaintively the lion pulled himself to his feet and slid over to the hedge bracing his back against its stouter branches It wont be long before we strike solid earth now old fellow the Wizard observed brightly Strike the earth roared the lion Well goodbye friends Ill say it now before Im squashed and scattered to the four points of the compass Never mind youll make a lovely splatter teased the Scarecrow Better stamp your feet girls to keep from freezing Here stand on my coat offered the Wizard gallantly Not YOU Indignantly he pushed the Soldier with Green Whiskers aside You can stand on your own coat But its against regulations for a soldier to appear without his jacket shivered Wantowin piteously The manual of arms saysFF20C4 How about the manual of feet snorted the Scarecrow thankful he was stuffed with cotton and incapable of feeling the cold Say Wiz I guess this is about the oddest flying trip a band of explorers ever had Did those magic drops freeze the air into ice called Dorothy And howd you grow the hedge so fast Yes the drops froze the air the Wizard bawled back for the rush of air as they shot downward made it difficult to hold polite conversation And I just happened to have some of my instant sprouting saplings in that kitbag To keep up their spirits they continued to shout back and forth as they fell I dont suppose well ever catch up with Strut and Nick Chopper now screamed Jellia hooking her arms secure
