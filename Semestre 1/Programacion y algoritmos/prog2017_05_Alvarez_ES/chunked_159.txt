 you buy it my dear he asked addressing Dorothy My gown isnt silk she said smiling Never mind When you open the box the rustles will escape whether you are wearing a silk dress or not said the man seriously Then he picked up another box In this he continued are many assorted flutters They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day when there is no wind You sir turning to the Wizard ought to have this assortment Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never be without them I have no money with me said the Wizard evasively I do not want money returned the braided man for I could not spend it in this deserted place if I had it But I would like very much a blue hairribbon You will notice my braids are tied with yellow pink brown red green white and black but I have no blue ribbons Ill get you one cried Dorothy who was sorry for the poor man so she ran back to the buggy and took from her suitcase a pretty blue ribbon It did her good to see how the braided mans eyes sparkled when he received this treasure You have made me very very happy my dear he exclaimed and then he insisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl accepting the box of rustles You may need them some time he said and there is really no use in my manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them Why did you leave the surface of the earth enquired the Wizard I could not help it It is a sad story but if you will try to restrain your tears I will tell you about it On earth I was a manufacturer of Imported Holes for American Swiss Cheese and I will acknowledge that I supplied a superior article which was in great demand Also I made pores for porous plasters and highgrade holes for doughnuts and buttons Finally I invented a new Adjustable Posthole which I thought would make my fortune I manufactured a large quantity of these postholes and having no room in which to store them I set them all end to end and put the top one in the ground That made an extraordinary long hole as you may imagine and reached far down into the earth and as I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom I lost my balance and tumbled in Unfortunately the hole led directly into the vast space you see outside this mountain but I managed to catch a point of rock that projected from this cavern and so saved myself from tumbling headlong into the black waves beneath where the tongues of flame that dart out would certainly have consumed me Here then I made my home and although it is a lonely place I amuse myself making rustles and flutters and so get along very nicely When the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearly laughed because it was all so absurd but the Wizard tapped his forehead significantly to indicate that he thought the poor man was crazy So they politely bade him good day and went back to the outer cavern to resume their journey 11 They Meet the Wooden Gargoyles Another breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing where there was a rift in the mountain On peering out all they could see was rolling banks of clouds so thick that they obscured all else But the travellers were obliged to rest and while they were sitting on the rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine tiny piglets To his delight they were now plainly visible which proved that they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley of Voe Why we can see each other again cried one joyfully Yes sighed Eureka and I also can see you again and the sight makes me dreadfully hungry Please Mr Wizard may I eat just one of the fat little piglets Youd never miss ONE of them Im sure What a horrid savage beast exclaimed a piglet and after weve been such good friends too and played with one another When Im not hungry I love to play with you all said the kitten demurely but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would fill it so nicely as a fat piglet And we trusted you so said another of the nine reproachfully And thought you were respectable said another It seems we were mistaken declared a third looking at the kitten timorously no one with such murderous desires should belong to our party Im sure You see Eureka remarked Dorothy reprovingly you are making yourself disliked There are certain things proper for a kitten to eat but I never heard of a kitten eating a pig under ANY cirstances Did you ever see such little pigs before asked the kitten They are no bigger than mice and Im sure mice are proper for me to eat It isnt the bigness dear its the variety replied the girl These are Mr Wizards pets just as you are my pet and it wouldnt be any more proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat you And thats just what I shall do if you dont let those little balls of pork alone said Jim glaring at the kitten with his round big eyes If you injure any one of them Ill chew you up instantly The kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully as if trying to decide whether he meant it or not In that case she said Ill le
