hout saying anything then in rather a gruff voice he called Dorothys attention to the changing nature of the scenery below Notice the hills he snorted more hopefully Maybe there is a mountain after all but the suns going down and Im ready to sink myself so lets descend and see whether we can find a soft rock on which to lay our heads Not hills dunes cried Dorothy bouncing off as soon as Pigasus touched the earth Sand dunes we must be near the coast and the Nonestic Ocean It does smell salty agreed Pigasus sniffing the air eagerly but suppose we save the ocean for tomorrow my feet ache my wings ache and Im hollow as a drum Then well have supper decided Dorothy sensibly So seating themselves comfortably with their backs against a dune the two weary explorers finished up all the cold meat fruit pie and sandwiches Shoofenwaller had packed up for them After a long wistful sniff into the box convinced him there was not another crumb Pigasus folded his wings and lay down in the soft sand at the foot of the dune giving only indistinct grunts and snorts to Dorothys questions and observations Finally getting no answer at all Dorothy discovered he was asleep The regular rise and fall of the pink pigs sides the soft drowsy singing of the west wind lulled Dorothy into a pleasant state of dreaminess and presently with her head comfortably pillowed on the pigs plump shoulder she fell asleep too It must have been hours later when terrified squeals from Pigasus and the patter of a hundred hurrying feet made her start up in alarm Still only half awake she was startled to find herself and Pigasus surrounded by a horde of savagelooking sandmen In the pale and watery moonlight they looked like creatures out of some very bad dream Their bodies were roughly moulded of sand their eyes strangely green and phosphorescent while their hair rising like beach grass from their pointed heads waved about their lumpy faces Clutching the basket that contained her small store of clothing the Black Witchs powder of darkness and Potaroos box of stumbling blocks Dorothy pressed back against the dune Her first idea of leaping on the pigs back and bidding him fly was useless Pigasus lay helplessly on his side his wings and legs bound tightly with long strands of tough strong seaweed Thankful to find that she at least was free Dorothy went a step closer to her struggling squealing furious little comrade As she did so a perfect shower of sand balls came flying toward her The sharp sting of the sandmens missiles not only awoke her completely but goaded her into instant and angry action Stop that Stop that at once she cried stamping her foot indignantly but her words only brought another shower of sand balls down on their heads You have dared to invade the sacred domain of the Dooners yelled the rasping voice of the leader rattling a long string of seashells he wore round his neck And therefore you shall be sand balled sand bagged and made into sandwiches for the sand crabs If the Dooner had not looked so wild and dangerous his foolish threat might have been amusing but as he and his bandylegged sandmen came leaping forward Pigasus gave a squeal of sheer terror and Dorothy raising the basket over her head hurled it with all her might into the midst of the advancing army The effect was immediate and astonishing Cowering down beside Pigasus and expecting to be seized or trampled on Dorothy saw the first line of Dooners going down like a row of tenpins then all the others began tumbling and tripping and falling in heaps No sooner would a sandman rise than he would instantly tumble down again and their squalls and screeches of rage were so piercing Dorothy put both hands over her ears Its the blocks wheezed Pigasus managing to lift his head a few inches Kalicos stumbling blocks are flying like fur and fury Now if they just keep em down for a while longer we might get away Dorothy peering sharply into the midst of the tumbling Dooners saw the fifty magic squares released from their box when she flung her basket fairly exploding with activity and scramble up as they would after each tumble the sandmen could not advance an inch or even manage to stand erect The leader attempting to crawl forward on his hands and knees was caught by a dozen of the whirling missiles and rolled back like a log among his churning comrades Hurray Three cheers for Kalico puffed Pigasus Quick my girl see if you can untie these wretched seaweeds and well be flying and be off in a pigwhistle I had a pair of scissors in my basket if it hasnt fallen out and anyway Im not going without my things declared Dorothy now quite bold since the enemy had been overcome by magic And in spite of the pigs anxious squeals of warning she rushed forward grabbed her basket and began picking up her scattered belongings noting with a sigh of relief that the box containing the powder of darkness was still closed With the scissors still safe in the little pocket in the side of the basket she soon clipped t
