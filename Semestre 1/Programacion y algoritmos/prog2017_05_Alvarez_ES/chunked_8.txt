f and Toto for the day When she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by What was that she asked timidly I cannot imagine replied the Scarecrow but we can go and see Just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them They turned and walked through the forest a few steps when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees She ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise One of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all Dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the Scarecrow while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth Did you groan asked Dorothy Yes answered the tin man I did Ive been groaning for more than a year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me What can I do for you she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke Get an oilcan and oil my joints he answered They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again You will find an oilcan on a shelf in my cottage Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oilcan and then she returned and asked anxiously Where are your joints Oil my neck first replied the Tin Woodman So she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and then the man could turn it himself Now oil the joints in my arms he said And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree This is a great comfort he said I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted and Im glad to be able to put it down at last Now if you will oil the joints of my legs I shall be all right once more So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful I might have stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life How did you happen to be here We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night Why do you wish to see Oz he asked I want him to send me back to Kansas and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head she replied The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment Then he said Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart Why I guess so Dorothy answered It would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains True the Tin Woodman returned So if you will allow me to join your party I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me Come along said the Scarecrow heartily and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oilcan in her basket For he said if I should get caught in the rain and rust again I would need the oilcan badly It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again Why didnt you walk around the hole asked the Tin Woodman I dont know enough replied the Scarecrow cheerfully My head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains Oh I see said the Tin Woodman But after all brains are not the best things in the world Have you any inquired the Scarecrow No my head is quite empty answered the Woodman But once I had brains and a heart also so having tried them both I should much rather have a heart And why is that asked the Scarecrow I will tell you my story and then you will know So while they were walking through the forest the Tin Woodman told the following story I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living When I grew up I too became a woodchopper and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry
