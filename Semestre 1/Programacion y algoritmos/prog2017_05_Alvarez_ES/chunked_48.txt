 think it over answered Mombi But we must get home at once for it is growing dark Help the Pumpkinhead to walk Never mind me said Jack I can walk as well as you can Havent I got legs and feet and arent they jointed Are they asked the woman turning to Tip Of course they are I made em myself returned the boy with pride So they started for the house but when they reached the farm yard old Mombi led the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty stall fastening the door securely on the outside Ive got to attend to you first she said nodding her head at Tip Hearing this the boy became uneasy for he 24 knew Mombi had a bad and revengeful heart and would not hesitate to do any evil thing They entered the house It was a round domeshaped structure as are nearly all the farm houses in the Land of Oz Mombi bade the boy light a candle while she put her basket in a cupboard and hung her cloak on a peg Tip obeyed quickly for he was afraid of her After the candle had been lighted Mombi ordered him to build a fire in the hearth and while Tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her supper When the flames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked a share of the bread and cheese but Mombi refused him Im hungry said Tip in a sulky tone You wont be hungry long replied Mombi with a grim look The boy didnt like this speech for it sounded like a threat but he happened to remember he had nuts in his pocket so he cracked some of those and ate them while the woman rose shook the crumbs from her apron and hung above the fire a small black kettle Then she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them into the kettle Next she 25 produced several packets of herbs and powders and began adding a portion of each to the contents of the kettle Occasionally she would draw near the candle and read from a yellow paper the recipe of the mess she was concocting As Tip watched her his uneasiness increased What is that for he asked For you returned Mombi briefly Tip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle which was beginning to bubble Then he would glance at the stern and wrinkled features of the witch and wish he were any place but in that dim and smoky kitchen where even the shadows cast by the candle upon the wall were enough to give one the horrors So an hour passed away during which the silence was only broken by the bubbling of the pot and the hissing of the flames Finally Tip spoke again Have I got to drink that stuff he asked nodding toward the pot Yes said Mombi Whatll it do to me asked Tip If its properly made replied Mombi it will change or transform you into a marble statue Tip groaned and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve 26 I dont want to be a marble statue he protested That doesnt matter I want you to be one said the old woman looking at him severely What usell I be then asked Tip There wont be any one to work for you Ill make the Pumpkinhead work for me said Mombi Again Tip groaned Why dont you change me into a goat or a chicken he asked anxiously You cant do anything with a marble statue Oh yes I can returned Mombi Im going to plant a flower garden next Spring and Ill put you in the middle of it for an ornament I wonder I havent thought of that before youve been a bother to me for years At this terrible speech Tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all over his body but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at the kettle Perhaps it wont work he mutttered in a voice that sounded weak and discouraged Oh I think it will answered Mombi cheerfully I seldom make a mistake Again there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that when Mombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to midnight 27 Full page lineart drawing I DONT WANT TO BE A MARBLE STATUE 28 You cannot drink it until it has become quite cold announced the old witch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising witchcraft We must both go to bed now and at daybreak I will call you and at once complete your transformation into a marble statue With this she hobbled into her room bearing the steaming kettle with her and Tip heard her close and lock the door The boy did not go to bed as he had been commanded to do but still sat glaring at the embers of the dying fire LineArt Drawing 29 The Flight of the Fugitives Tip reflected Its a hard thing to be a marble statue he thought rebelliously and Im not going to stand it For years Ive been a bother to her she says so shes going to get rid of me Well theres an easier way than to become a statue No boy could have any fun forever standing in the middle of a flower garden Ill run away thats what Ill doand I may as well go before she makes me drink that nasty stuff in the kettle He waited until the snores of the old witch announced she was fast asleep and then he arose softly and went to the cupboard to find something to eat 30 No use starting on a journey without food he decided searching upon the narrow shelves
