ave them alone You havent many teeth left Jim but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder So the piglets will be perfectly safe hereafter as far as I am concerned That is right Eureka remarked the Wizard earnestly Let us all be a happy family and love one another Eureka yawned and stretched herself Ive always loved the piglets she said but they dont love me No one can love a person hes afraid of asserted Dorothy If you behave and dont scare the little pigs Im sure theyll grow very fond of you The Wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and the journey was resumed We must be pretty near the top now said the boy as they climbed wearily up the dark winding stairway The Country of the Gurgles cant be far from the top of the earth remarked Dorothy It isnt very nice down here Id like to get home again Im sure No one replied to this because they found they needed all their breath for the climb The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizard often had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another or keep it from jamming against the rocky walls At last however a dim light appeared ahead of them which grew clearer and stronger as they advanced Thank goodness were nearly there panted the little Wizard Jim who was in advance saw the last stair before him and stuck his head above the rocky sides of the stairway Then he halted ducked down and began to back up so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the others Lets go down again he said in his hoarse voice Nonsense snapped the tired Wizard Whats the matter with you old man Everything grumbled the horse Ive taken a look at this place and its no fit country for real creatures to go to Everythings dead up thereno flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere Never mind we cant turn back said Dorothy and we dont intend to stay there anyhow Its dangerous growled Jim in a stubborn tone See here my good steed broke in the Wizard little Dorothy and I have been in many queer countries in our travels and always escaped without harm Weve even been to the marvelous Land of Ozhavent we Dorothyso we dont much care what the Country of the Gargoyles is like Go ahead Jim and whatever happens well make the best of it All right answered the horse this is your excursion and not mine so if you get into trouble dont blame me With this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remaining steps The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broad platform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyes had ever beheld The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden exclaimed Zeb and so it was The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard knots from trees worn smooth in course of time There were odd wooden houses with carved wooden flowers in the front yards The treetrunks were of coarse wood but the leaves of the trees were shavings The patches of grass were splinters of wood and where neither grass nor sawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring Wooden birds fluttered among the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass but the most amazing things of all were the wooden peoplethe creatures known as Gargoyles These were very numerous for the place was thickly inhabited and a large group of the queer people clustered near gazing sharply upon the strangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway The Gargoyles were very small of stature being less than three feet in height Their bodies were round their legs short and thick and their arms extraordinarily long and stout Their heads were too big for their bodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon Some had long curved noses and chins small eyes and wide grinning mouths Others had flat noses protruding eyes and ears that were shaped like those of an elephant There were many types indeed scarcely two being alike but all were equally disagreeable in appearance The tops of their heads had no hair but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes some having a row of points or balls around the top others designs resembling flowers or vegetables and still others having squares that looked like waffles cut crisscross on their heads They all wore short wooden wings which were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hinges with wooden screws and with these wings they flew swiftly and noiselessly here and there their legs being of little use to them This noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about the Gargoyles They made no sounds at all either in flying or trying to speak and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with their wooden fingers or lips Neither was there any sound to be heard anywhere throughout the wooden country The birds did not sing nor did the cows moo yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere The group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered near the stairs at first remained staring and motionless glaring with evil eyes at the intruders who had so suddenly a
