ore coming to a high bridge over a broad river This river the Tin Woodman informed them was the boundary between the Country of the Winkies and the territory of the Emerald City The city itself was still a long way off but all around it was a green meadow as pretty as a wellkept lawn and in this were neither houses nor farms to spoil the beauty of the scene From the top of the high bridge they could see far away the magnificent spires and splendid domes of the superb city sparkling like brilliant jewels as they towered above the emerald walls The shaggy man drew a deep breath of awe and amazement for never had he dreamed that such a grand and beautiful place could existeven in the fairyland of Oz Polly was so pleased that her violet eyes sparkled like amethysts and she danced away from her companions across the bridge and into a group of feathery trees lining both the roadsides These trees she stopped to look at with pleasure and surprise for their leaves were shaped like ostrich plumes their feather edges beautifully curled and all the plumes were tinted in the same dainty rainbow hues that appeared in Polychromes own pretty gauze gown Father ought to see these trees she murmured they are almost as lovely as his own rainbows Then she gave a start of terror for beneath the trees came stalking two great beasts either one big enough to crush the little Daughter of the Rainbow with one blow of his paws or to eat her up with one snap of his enormous jaws One was a tawny lion as tall as a horse nearly the other a striped tiger almost the same size Polly was too frightened to scream or to stir she stood still with a wildly beating heart until Dorothy rushed past her and with a glad cry threw her arms around the huge lions neck hugging and kissing the beast with evident joy Oh Im SO glad to see you again cried the little Kansas girl And the Hungry Tiger too How fine youre both looking Are you well and happy We certainly are Dorothy answered the Lion in a deep voice that sounded pleasant and kind and we are greatly pleased that you have come to Ozmas party Its going to be a grand affair I promise you There will be lots of fat babies at the celebration I hear remarked the Hungry Tiger yawning so that his mouth opened dreadfully wide and showed all his big sharp teeth but of course I cant eat any of em Is your Conscience still in good order asked Dorothy anxiously Yes it rules me like a tyrant answered the Tiger sorrowfully I can imagine nothing more unpleasant than to own a Conscience and he winked slyly at his friend the Lion Youre fooling me said Dorothy with a laugh I dont blieve youd eat a baby if you lost your Conscience Come here Polly she called and be introduced to my friends Polly advanced rather shyly You have some queer friends Dorothy she said The queerness doesnt matter so long as theyre friends was the answer This is the Cowardly Lion who isnt a coward at all but just thinks he is The Wizard gave him some courage once and he has part of it left The Lion bowed with great dignity to Polly You are very lovely my dear said he I hope we shall be friends when we are better acquainted And this is the Hungry Tiger continued Dorothy He says he longs to eat fat babies but the truth is he is never hungry at all cause he gets plenty to eat and I dont spose hed hurt anybody even if he WAS hungry Hush Dorothy whispered the Tiger youll ruin my reputation if you are not more discreet It isnt what we are but what folks think we are that counts in this world And come to think of it Miss Polly would make a fine variegated breakfast Im sure 18 The Emerald City The others now came up and the Tin Woodman greeted the Lion and the Tiger cordially ButtonBright yelled with fear when Dorothy first took his hand and led him toward the great beasts but the girl insisted they were kind and good and so the boy mustered up courage enough to pat their heads after they had spoken to him gently and he had looked into their intelligent eyes his fear vanished entirely and he was so delighted with the animals that he wanted to keep close to them and stroke their soft fur every minute As for the shaggy man he might have been afraid if he had met the beasts alone or in any other country but so many were the marvels in the Land of Oz that he was no longer easily surprised and Dorothys friendship for the Lion and Tiger was enough to assure him they were safe companions Toto barked at the Cowardly Lion in joyous greeting for he knew the beast of old and loved him and it was funny to see how gently the Lion raised his huge paw to pat Totos head The little dog smelled of the Tigers nose and the Tiger politely shook paws with him so they were quite likely to become firm friends Tiktok and Billina knew the beasts well so merely bade them good day and asked after their healths and inquired about the Princess Ozma Now it was seen that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were drawing behind them a splendid golden chariot to which they were harnesse
