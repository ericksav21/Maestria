lina stuck her bill deep into the sand and then drew back and shivered Ow she cried I struck metal that time and it nearly broke my beak It probbly was a rock said Dorothy carelessly Nonsense I know a rock from metal I guess said the hen Theres a different feel to it But there couldnt be any metal on this wild deserted seashore persisted the girl Wheres the place Ill dig it up and prove to you Im right Billina showed her the place where she had stubbed her bill as she expressed it and Dorothy dug away the sand until she felt something hard Then thrusting in her hand she pulled the thing out and discovered it to be a large sized golden keyrather old but still bright and of perfect shape What did I tell you cried the hen with a cackle of triumph Can I tell metal when I bump into it or is the thing a rock Its metal sure enough answered the child gazing thoughtfully at the curious thing she had found I think it is pure gold and it must have lain hidden in the sand for a long time How do you suppose it came there Billina And what do you suppose this mysterious key unlocks I cant say replied the hen You ought to know more about locks and keys than I do Dorothy glanced around There was no sign of any house in that part of the country and she reasoned that every key must fit a lock and every lock must have a purpose Perhaps the key had been lost by somebody who lived far away but had wandered on this very shore Musing on these things the girl put the key in the pocket of her dress and then slowly drew on her shoes and stockings which the sun had fully dried I blieve Billina she said Ill have a look round and see if I can find some breakfast 3 Letters in the Sand Walking a little way back from the waters edge toward the grove of trees Dorothy came to a flat stretch of white sand that seemed to have queer signs marked upon its surface just as one would write upon sand with a stick What does it say she asked the yellow hen who trotted along beside her in a rather dignified fashion How should I know returned the hen I cannot read Oh Cant you Certainly not Ive never been to school you know Well I have admitted Dorothy but the letters are big and far apart and its hard to spell out the words But she looked at each letter carefully and finally discovered that these words were written in the sand BEWARE THE WHEELERS Thats rather strange declared the hen when Dorothy had read aloud the words What do you suppose the Wheelers are Folks that wheel I guess They must have wheelbarrows or babycabs or handcarts said Dorothy Perhaps theyre automobiles suggested the yellow hen There is no need to beware of babycabs and wheelbarrows but automobiles are dangerous things Several of my friends have been run over by them It cant be autobiles replied the girl for this is a new wild country without even trolleycars or telphones The people here havent been discovered yet Im sure that is if there ARE any people So I dont blieve there CAN be any autobiles Billina Perhaps not admitted the yellow hen Where are you going now Over to those trees to see if I can find some fruit or nuts answered Dorothy She tramped across the sand skirting the foot of one of the little rocky hills that stood near and soon reached the edge of the forest At first she was greatly disappointed because the nearer trees were all punita or cottonwood or eucalyptus and bore no fruit or nuts at all But bye and bye when she was almost in despair the little girl came upon two trees that promised to furnish her with plenty of food One was quite full of square paper boxes which grew in clusters on all the limbs and upon the biggest and ripest boxes the word Lunch could be read in neat raised letters This tree seemed to bear all the year around for there were lunchbox blossoms on some of the branches and on others tiny little lunchboxes that were as yet quite green and evidently not fit to eat until they had grown bigger The leaves of this tree were all paper napkins and it presented a very pleasing appearance to the hungry little girl But the tree next to the lunchbox tree was even more wonderful for it bore quantities of tin dinnerpails which were so full and heavy that the stout branches bent underneath their weight Some were small and darkbrown in color those larger were of a dull tin color but the really ripe ones were pails of bright tin that shone and glistened beautifully in the rays of sunshine that touched them Dorothy was delighted and even the yellow hen acknowledged that she was surprised The little girl stood on tiptoe and picked one of the nicest and biggest lunchboxes and then she sat down upon the ground and eagerly opened it Inside she found nicely wrapped in white papers a ham sandwich a piece of spongecake a pickle a slice of new cheese and an apple Each thing had a separate stem and so had to be picked off the side of the box but Dorothy found them all to be delicious and she ate every bit of luncheon in the box before she had finished A lunch isnt zactly br
