 the safe probably will blow away and all the treasures with it Then how in the Dix shall I open it screamed Strut giving it a spiteful kick with his silvershod toe Worn out by his long vigil of the night and the excitement of taking possession of the castle he lost his temper completely and stamped and raged up and down before Ozmas jeweled strongbox But thump and bang at the door as he would it still remained shut Ha he puffed at last Ill call my swordsmith He can hammer it open Racing over to the window he yelled for the Swordsmith to come up But Struts Swordsmith had no more success than his Master Kindling a fire in the grate he heated a poker red hot and tried to burn a hole in the door but the poker did not leave even a scratch on the glittering surface Stop Stop You witless Woff Ill do it myself raged Strut Ill blow it open with star powder Surely you wouldnt do that protested Nick who up to this time had been watching the effort of the two airmen with quiet amusement If you blow up the safe you might set fire to the castle and destroy all the treasures you have won Oh hold your tongue advised Strut Dragging two smouldering logs from the grate he shoved them under the safe Then unscrewing the end of his flying stick he sprinkled a fine black powder that smelled and looked like gunpowder over the logs Lighting a twisted paper he stuck it beneath the logs and jumped back waiting impatiently for the safe to fly apart Nick Chopper waited not a moment longer Darting into the dressing room he hastily filled a pitcher with water But before he could return an earsplitting explosion rocked the castle and flung him and the pitcher through the doorway of the sitting room Without stopping to recover his breath the Tin Woodman jumped up and hurried across the room The two airmen with blackened clothes and faces stared dazedly at the spot where the safe had been Where it had been C4 because the safe was no longer there Not a sign emerald or single splinter of it There was no hole in the ceiling so it could not have blown up there was no hole in the floor so it could not have blown down The windows were unbroken the walls intact Only the two logs smoking sullenly on Ozmas priceless rug remained of the Airlanders bonfire C4 unless we count the expression on Struts face which simply blazed with wrath bafflement and unadulterated fury CHAPTER 19 THE TRAVELERS RETURN I told you not to do that said Nick running over to Strut and the Swordsmith I warned you Now see what youve done But where is it Where did it go Where did it BLOW screamed the Airlander his electric hair standing more on end than ever and crackling like summer lightning Ask Ozma Ask the Wizard suggested Nick folding his arms and surveying the two quite calmly But if you take my advice youll hustle right out of this castle before the same thing happens to YOU Who asked for your advice cried Strut streaking over to the window to see whether the safe had blown into the garden though how it could have done so without knocking a hole in the wall or ceiling he could neither imagine nor understand Drawing aside the curtain he gave a great gasp Nick who had hurried after him uttered a loud shout of joy See I told you cried Nick and unhooking his oil can the Tin Woodman let four drops of oil slide down his neck I told you Strut made no reply He just hung on to the curtain as if he were drowning and the flimsy portiere a life preserver See shouted Nick again But it was Strut didnt see that upset the Airman What he didnt see was his entire army of nine hundred and ninetynine splendid fighters The garden below was as empty and quiet as a park on a rainy Sunday Calm yourself Man Calm yourself advised Nick as Strut turning from the window and noting the disappearance of his Swordsmith began running in frenzied circles overturning chairs and tables and tripping over rugs and footstools Quick he hissed making a dive for the Tin Woodman Fly me back to the Strat At once At ONCE Do you hear Oh yes I hear you quite well said Nick eluding Strut easily But Ill never fly you anywhere again Besides dont you realize you cannot fly from magic Youll have to stay my good man and face the music Nicks words seemed to bring the Airlander to his senses Remembering even in defeat that he was a powerful King and Ruler he straightened up proudly and with one hand resting on an emeraldtopped table stood looking tensely from Nick Chopper to the door He did not have long to wait for in less time than it takes to count ten nine excited Ozians burst into the Royal Sitting room Oh Nick Are you really safe Is everything all right Jellia Jam rushed over to the Tin Woodman and took both of his hands in her own So thats the fellow I was supposed to impersonate roared the Cowardly Lion thrusting his head between Dorothy and the Soldier Well Goosengravy girls Im insulted And is this really Strut the high and mighty Stratovanian who has come to conquer us Ozma who was just behind the Soldier gazed so
