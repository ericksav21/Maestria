 button board with grim purpose and determination Now we can take our time and start off right Oh Nick must we go through all that again Jellia began to cry softly drying her eyes on the sash of her party dress Oh Nick I never thought flying would be like this Please cant we just stay as we are Certainly not said the Tin Woodman briskly Hanging round the sky is dangerous We might be hit by a shooting star or even by a meteor Now just trust yourself to me my dear Jellia Remember I am the Emperor of the East Nick smote his tin chest a resounding blow And after ruling the Winkies all these years I surely can handle one small plane Reassuring himself if not Jellia the Tin Woodman searched the array of buttons for one marked slow After he had found it he slowly began to map his course He would continue to fly up for a time Next he would take a horizontal direction until he grew more accustomed to piloting the Ozoplane Then as night passed and the sun rose he would zig and zag slowly downward and make a safe landing near the Emerald City The Soldier with Green Whiskers had regained consciousness only to fall at once into a heavy slumber His snores blended nicely with Jellias sobs as Nick Chopper pushed the up the South and the slow buttons Braced for a new shock Jellia grasped the arms of her seat But this time the Oztober soared gently and gracefully aloft the motion of the plane so smooth and pleasant Ozmas little Maid in Waiting soon forgot all her fears Relaxing against the soft green cushions she too fell asleep This left only Nick awake and alert But if the Wizard had searched all over Oz he could not have found a better pilot than the Tin Woodman Being practically tireless and requiring neither food nor rest he could keep his place at the wheel for days if necessary Delighted at the way the Oztober responded to his clever manipulation of the wheel and buttons he flew up and up and on and on scarcely realizing the distance he was putting between himself and Oz Glancing out the round window beside him Nick viewed the starry expanse of the upper air with growing interest and enthusiasm Sometimes he was almost tempted to waken Jellia to point out the splendid cloud mountains and cities they were passing As he swept along the sky turned from deep blue grey and was now suffused with the rainbow tints of early morning Switching off the lights the Tin Woodman slightly changed his course I really need a lot more practice before I go back or try to make a safe landing he observed softly to himself It never would do to crack up a valuable ship like this But the truth of the matter was the Tin Woodman did not wish to turn back And after all who was to insist The Soldier and Jellia still slept on and far ahead between a bank of fog and an arch of platinum sun rays loomed a long lavender crescent Nick even fancied he could see people moving about its glittering surface A new world gloated the Tin Woodman setting his funnel at a more daring 20angle If this were so he would be its discoverer Not only that but he could claim it for Ozma and win for himself as much honor and renown as Samuel Salt the Royal Explorer of Oz Even if its not inhabited it would be a good place to practice landing reflected Nick happily So again he pressed the black bar touched the button to deflate the Oztobers balloon and raise the wings For now he wished to fly horizontally and the wings would be faster than the gas bag Next touching the straighton and faster buttons and twirling the wheel expertly he headed the ship straight for the tip of the lavender island CHAPTER 5 THE SPIKERS Nick waited until he was well over the crescent before he attempted to land As he flew along he planned exactly how he would go about it and everything worked out as planned except for one thing The slow the zig and the down buttons brought the Oztober within a foot of the glittering air Isle but the stop button functioned a bit late Instead of stopping on the surface the plane dropped clear through with a crash like the smashing of a thousand thin tumblers Peering up through a spray of splinters the Tin Woodman found he had knocked a jagged hole in the Crescent Attention Shoulder arms Company fall in yelled the Soldier with Green Whiskers Jolted completely awake he sprang up in the aisle aiming his gun at the ceiling Yes Yes Coming your Majesty Jellia mistaking the musical crash for the ringing of Ozmas morning bell rolled sleepily out of her seat and started down the aisle after the Soldier Now now dont be alarmed remarked Nick Chopper I was just trying to land Land Where is it Quick Let me out of here panted Jellia Jam remembering all in a rush where she was and the dreadful experiences of the night before I see no land said the Soldier pressing his nose against one of the windows Well it certainly looked like land The Tin Woodman spoke in a slightly exasperated voice The Oztober still quivering from its impact with the island was hanging motionless about ten feet
