cheerfully Let us be friends and talk this over in a friendly manner To be sure agreed the King his eyes twinkling merrily I am very anxious she continued to liberate the Queen of Ev and her children who are now ornaments and bricabrac in your Majestys palace and to restore them to their people Tell me sir how this may be accomplished The king remained thoughtful for a moment after which he asked Are you willing to take a few chances and risks yourself in order to set free the people of Ev Yes indeed answered Ozma eagerly Then said the Nome King I will make you this offer You shall go alone and unattended into my palace and examine carefully all that the rooms contain Then you shall have permission to touch eleven different objects pronouncing at the time the word Ev and if any one of them or more than one proves to be the transformation of the Queen of Ev or any of her ten children then they will instantly be restored to their true forms and may leave my palace and my kingdom in your company without any objection whatever It is possible for you in this way to free the entire eleven but if you do not guess all the objects correctly and some of the slaves remain transformed then each one of your friends and followers may in turn enter the palace and have the same privileges I grant you Oh thank you thank you for this kind offer said Ozma eagerly I make but one condition added the Nome King his eyes twinkling What is it she enquired If none of the eleven objects you touch proves to be the transformation of any of the royal family of Ev then instead of freeing them you will yourself become enchanted and transformed into an article of bricabrac or an ornament This is only fair and just and is the risk you declared you were willing to take 12 The Eleven Guesses Hearing this condition imposed by the Nome King Ozma became silent and thoughtful and all her friends looked at her uneasily Dont you do it exclaimed Dorothy If you guess wrong you will be enslaved yourself But I shall have eleven guesses answered Ozma Surely I ought to guess one object in eleven correctly and if I do I shall rescue one of the royal family and be safe myself Then the rest of you may attempt it and soon we shall free all those who are enslaved What if we fail enquired the Scarecrow Id look nice as a piece of bricabrac wouldnt I We must not fail cried Ozma courageously Having come all this distance to free these poor people it would be weak and cowardly in us to abandon the adventure Therefore I will accept the Nome Kings offer and go at once into the royal palace Come along then my dear said the King climbing down from his throne with some difficulty because he was so fat Ill show you the way He approached a wall of the cave and waved his hand Instantly an opening appeared through which Ozma after a smiling farewell to her friends boldly passed She found herself in a splendid hall that was more beautiful and grand than anything she had ever beheld The ceilings were composed of great arches that rose far above her head and all the walls and floors were of polished marble exquisitely tinted in many colors Thick velvet carpets were on the floor and heavy silken draperies covered the arches leading to the various rooms of the palace The furniture was made of rare old woods richly carved and covered with delicate satins and the entire palace was lighted by a mysterious rosy glow that seemed to come from no particular place but flooded each apartment with its soft and pleasing radiance Ozma passed from one room to another greatly delighted by all she saw The lovely palace had no other occupant for the Nome King had left her at the entrance which closed behind her and in all the magnificent rooms there appeared to be no other person Upon the mantels and on many shelves and brackets and tables were clustered ornaments of every description seemingly made out of all sorts of metals glass china stones and marbles There were vases and figures of men and animals and graven platters and bowls and mosaics of precious gems and many other things Pictures too were on the walls and the underground palace was quite a museum of rare and curious and costly objects After her first hasty examination of the rooms Ozma began to wonder which of all the numerous ornaments they contained were the transformations of the royal family of Ev There was nothing to guide her for everything seemed without a spark of life So she must guess blindly and for the first time the girl came to realize how dangerous was her task and how likely she was to lose her own freedom in striving to free others from the bondage of the Nome King No wonder the cunning monarch laughed good naturedly with his visitors when he knew how easily they might be entrapped But Ozma having undertaken the venture would not abandon it She looked at a silver candelabra that had ten branches and thought This may be the Queen of Ev and her ten children So she touched it and uttered aloud the word Ev as the Nome
