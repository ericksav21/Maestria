peared Then the chariot driver turned her Lion and Tiger into a broad roadway leading up to the palace and the others followed while Dorothy still gazed from her tower window in eager excitement They came quite close to the front door of the palace and then halted the Scarecrow dismounting from his SawHorse to approach the sign fastened to the door that he might read what it said Dorothy just above him could keep silent no longer Here I am she shouted as loudly as she could Heres Dorothy Dorothy who asked the Scarecrow tipping his head to look upward until he nearly lost his balance and tumbled over backward Dorothy Gale of course Your friend from Kansas she answered Why hello Dorothy said the Scarecrow What in the world are you doing up there Nothing she called down because theres nothing to do Save me my friendsave me You seem to be quite safe now replied the Scarecrow But Im a prisoner Im locked in so that I cant get out she pleaded Thats all right said the Scarecrow You might be worse off little Dorothy Just consider the matter You cant get drowned or be run over by a Wheeler or fall out of an appletree Some folks would think they were lucky to be up there Well I dont declared the girl and I want to get down immeditly and see you and the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion Very well said the Scarecrow nodding It shall be just as you say little friend Who locked you up The princess Langwidere who is a horrid creature she answered At this Ozma who had been listening carefully to the conversation called to Dorothy from her chariot asking Why did the Princess lock you up my dear Because exclaimed Dorothy I wouldnt let her have my head for her collection and take an old castoff head in exchange for it I do not blame you exclaimed Ozma promptly I will see the Princess at once and oblige her to liberate you Oh thank you very very much cried Dorothy who as soon as she heard the sweet voice of the girlish Ruler of Oz knew that she would soon learn to love her dearly Ozma now drove her chariot around to the third door of the wing upon which the Tin Woodman boldly proceeded to knock As soon as the maid opened the door Ozma bearing in her hand her ivory wand stepped into the hall and made her way at once to the drawingroom followed by all her company except the Lion and the Tiger And the twentyseven soldiers made such a noise and a clatter that the little maid Nanda ran away screaming to her mistress whereupon the Princess Langwidere roused to great anger by this rude invasion of her palace came running into the drawingroom without any assistance whatever There she stood before the slight and delicate form of the little girl from Oz and cried out How dare you enter my palace unbidden Leave this room at once or I will bind you and all your people in chains and throw you into my darkest dungeons What a dangerous lady murmured the Scarecrow in a soft voice She seems a little nervous replied the Tin Woodman But Ozma only smiled at the angry Princess Sit down please she said quietly I have traveled a long way to see you and you must listen to what I have to say Must screamed the Princess her black eyes flashing with furyfor she still wore her No 17 head Must to ME To be sure said Ozma I am Ruler of the Land of Oz and I am powerful enough to destroy all your kingdom if I so wish Yet I did not come here to do harm but rather to free the royal family of Ev from the thrall of the Nome King the news having reached me that he is holding the Queen and her children prisoners Hearing these words Langwidere suddenly became quiet I wish you could indeed free my aunt and her ten royal children said she eagerly For if they were restored to their proper forms and station they could rule the Kingdom of Ev themselves and that would save me a lot of worry and trouble At present there are at least ten minutes every day that I must devote to affairs of state and I would like to be able to spend my whole time in admiring my beautiful heads Then we will presently discuss this matter said Ozma and try to find a way to liberate your aunt and cousins But first you must liberate another prisonerthe little girl you have locked up in your tower Of course said Langwidere readily I had forgotten all about her That was yesterday you know and a Princess cannot be expected to remember today what she did yesterday Come with me and I will release the prisoner at once So Ozma followed her and they passed up the stairs that led to the room in the tower While they were gone Ozmas followers remained in the drawingroom and the Scarecrow was leaning against a form that he had mistaken for a copper statue when a harsh metallic voice said suddenly in his ear Get off my foot please You are scratching my polish Oh excuse me he replied hastily drawing back Are you alive No said Tiktok I am only a machine But I can think and speak and act when I am properly wound up Just now my action is run down and Dorothy has the key to it Thats all right replied the Scarecrow Dor
