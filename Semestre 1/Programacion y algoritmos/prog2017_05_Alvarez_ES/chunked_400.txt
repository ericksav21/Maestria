ot where the staff had struck him Someone or something was protecting you declared the little Jinn nodding his head like a mandarin Do you carry any charms or talismans against evil my boy Not a one Turning out his pockets Randy displayed a collection of knives rubber bands coins and the other odds and ends that a man usually stores in his pockets Among the strange assortment were two small squat jars and on these Jinnicky pounced with a triumphant little crow Why Randy Spandy Jack a Dandy you have two bottles of my best weaponturning elixir How did you happen to have them Those Randy squinted down at the bottles in positive mystification Oh I must have picked them up in the cellar Of course I did I remember distinctly now Oh glory be Glory me Har har har Am I a good wizard or am I a good wizard And to think you should have happened on the very thing youd be needing Jinnicky danced in exuberant circles Shhush Somebodys coming Crowding all his belongings back into his pocket Randy turned in alarm Half the courtiers and servants were crowded into the doorway And when they saw Jinnicky and his friends instead of Gludwig in the Royal Apartment they began to back away in chagrin and embarrassment Oh its all right Jinnicky waved airily You threw in your fortunes with the wrong man thats all Youll find Gludwig below in the cabbages But I forgive you I forgive you he added impulsively as his former mine workers began to stammer apologies and excuses Go back to your beds now but see that breakfast is on time and hot and appetizing With an impatient nod of his head Jinnicky dismissed them and looking very downcast and crestfallen they hurried away It was a long time before the Red Jinn and his rescuers could bring themselves to retire There was so much to talk of to wonder over and to plan But finally even Randy acknowledged that he was sleepy and confident that Jinnicky would find some way to help Planetty and Thun in the morning he curled up on a small red sofa and fell into a peaceful slumber As for Kabumpo he stretched out on the floor and Jinnicky not caring to occupy a bed so recently slept in by Gludwig made himself comfortable on a bear rug beside the Elegant Elephant enjoying the first real rest he had had in seven long months CHAPTER 18 THE RED JINN RESTORED Word of his return had quickly spread through the Red Jinns vast dominions and when Jinnicky and his guests descended next morning a whole loyal black legion were cheering from the courtyard and lined up along the shore After Gludwig had seized the castle and enslaved the household the rest of the natives had fled for their lives refusing to stay or acknowledge the redwigged imposter as their ruler Now that Jinnicky was restored and safely at home again their joy knew no bounds Appearing briefly on one of the castle balconies the Red Jinn made one of his best and merriest speeches telling of his experiences and assuring his faithful flock that Gludwig was gone and would trouble them no more To prove his statement he pointed to the fallen figure in the cabbage patch Glubdo fearing Jinnickys anger had already left for an unknown destination and now there was nothing to be done but restore the Kingdom to its former cheerful status and prosperity While the Red Jinn Kabumpo Randy and Nina breakfasted happily on the terrace a willing delegation marched off to the ruby mines to release Alibabble the courtiers and servants from their long servitude The miners who had taken their place in the castle and army were only too willing to return to the mines for with Jinnicky back in power their hours were short their wages high and each miner had his own cozy cottage and garden The petrified miners who had served in the army that issued out to capture Randy and Kabumpo were stood along the highways to act as signposts and also as warning to all of the hard fate awaiting those who lent their ears to treachery and their arms to rebellion Randy could hardly contain himself while all these necessary matters were attended to The young monarch spent nearly all his time arranging and rearranging the cushions on Jinnickys throne where Planetty still lay in complete beauty and insensibility Kabumpo was almost as bad pacing anxiously between the throne and the terrace where Thun had been carried by fifty interested blacks Even if I cannot bring them back to life and activity they are a handsome addition to any castle puffed Jinnicky sinking down at last on one of his red lacquer sofas and fanning himself rapidly with his lid Oh my mercy me Dont look at me that way my boy Of course Ill do my best and double best But suppose my best is not good enough Oh it will be declared Kabumpo giving the Red Jinn a pat on the back with his trunk Ill bet on your red magic any day in the year Look at the way that elixir saved Randy from the magic staff Where is Planettys staff by the way Sort of dangerous to leave it about Its locked up safely in my iron cabinet said Jinnicky closing one eye
