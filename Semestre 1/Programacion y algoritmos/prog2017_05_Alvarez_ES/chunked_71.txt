w a curious sight Seated within the glittering throne was General Jinjur with the Scarecrows secondbest crown upon her head and the royal sceptre in her right hand A box of caramels from which she was eating rested in her lap and the girl seemed entirely at ease in her royal surroundings The Scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her while the Tin Woodman leaned upon his axe and the others formed a halfcircle back of his Majestys person How dare you sit in my throne demanded the Scarecrow sternly eyeing the intruder Dont you know you are guilty of treason and that there is a law against treason The throne belongs to whoever is able to take it answered Jinjur as she slowly ate another caramel I have taken it as you see so just now I am the Queen and all who oppose me are guilty of 174 treason and must be punished by the law you have just mentioned This view of the case puzzled the Scarecrow How is it friend Nick he asked turning to the Tin Woodman Why when it comes to Law I have nothing to say answered that personage for laws were never meant to be understood and it is foolish to make the attempt Then what shall we do asked the Scarecrow in dismay Why dont you marry the Queen And then you can both rule suggested the WoggleBug Jinjur glared at the insect fiercely Why dont you send her back to her mother where she belongs asked Jack Pumpkinhead Jinjur frowned Why dont you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself and promises to be good enquired Tip Jinjurs lip curled scornfully Or give her a good shaking added the SawHorse No said the Tin Woodman we must treat the poor girl with gentleness Let us give her all the Jewels she can carry and send her away happy and contented 175 At this Queen Jinjur laughed aloud and the next minute clapped her pretty hands together thrice as if for a signal You are very absurd creatures said she but I am tired of your nonsense and have no time to bother with you longer While the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent speech a startling thing happened The Tin Woodmans axe was snatched from his grasp by some person behind him and he found himself disarmed and helpless At the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the devoted band and turning to see whence this came they found themselves surrounded by the Army of Revolt the girls bearing in either hand their glistening knittingneedles The entire throne room seemed to be filled with the rebels and the Scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were prisoners You see how foolish it is to oppose a womans wit said Jinjur gaily and this event only proves that I am more fit to rule the Emerald City than a Scarecrow I bear you no ill will I assure you but lest you should prove troublesome to me in the future I shall order you all to be destroyed That is all except the boy who belongs to old Mombi and must be restored to her keeping The rest of 176 you are not human and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you The SawHorse and the Pumpkinheads body I will have chopped up for kindling wood and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts The Scarecrow will do nicely to start a bonfire and the tin man can be cut into small pieces and fed to the goats As for this immense WoggleBug Highly Magnified if you please interrupted the insect I think I will ask the cook to make greenturtle soup of you continued the Queen reflectively The WoggleBug shuddered Or if that wont do we might use you for a Hungarian goulash stewed and highly spiced she added cruelly This programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners looked upon one another in a panic of fear The Scarecrow alone did not give way to despair He stood quietly before the Queen and his brow was wrinkled in deep thought as he strove to find some means to escape While thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently At once his expression changed from sadness to joy and raising his hand he quickly unbuttoned the front of his jacket This action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd 177 of girls clustering about him but none of them suspected what he was doing until a tiny grey mouse leaped from his bosom to the floor and scampered LineArt Drawing away between the feet of the Army of Revolt Another mouse quickly followed then another and another in rapid succession And suddenly such a 178 scream of terror went up from the Army that it might easily have filled the stoutest heart with consternation The flight that ensued turned to a stampede and the stampede to a panic For while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the Scarecrow had only time to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the girls disappeared from the palacepushing and crowding one another in their mad efforts to escape The Queen at the first alarm stood up on the cushions of the throne and began to dance frantically upon her tiptoes Then a mouse ran up the cushions and with a terrified leap poor Jinjur shot clear over the head of the Scarecrow a
