 Glindas tent Tell your Queen said the Sorceress to the girl that she must deliver up to me old Mombi to be my prisoner If this is done I will not molest her farther LineArt Drawing 250 Now when this message was delivered to the Queen it filled her with dismay for Mombi was her chief counsellor and Jinjur was terribly afraid of the old hag But she sent for Mombi and told her what Glinda had said I see trouble ahead for all of us muttered the old witch after glancing into a magic mirror she carried in her pocket But we may even yet escape by deceiving this sorceress clever as she thinks herself Dont you think it will be safer for me to deliver you into her hands asked Jinjur nervously If you do it will cost you the throne of the Emerald City answered the witch positively But if you will let me have my own way I can save us both very easily Then do as you please replied Jinjur for it is so aristocratic to be a Queen that I do not wish to be obliged to return home again to make beds and wash dishes for my mother So Mombi called Jellia Jamb to her and performed a certain magical rite with which she was familiar As a result of the enchantment Jellia took on the form and features of Mombi while the old witch grew to resemble the girl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception 251 Now said old Mombi to the Queen let your soldiers deliver up this girl to Glinda She will think she has the real Mombi in her power and so will return immediately to her own country in the South Therefore Jellia hobbling along like an aged LineArt Drawing woman was led from the city gates and taken before Glinda Here is the person you demanded said one of the guards and our Queen now begs you will go away as you promised and leave us in peace That I will surely do replied Glinda much pleased if this is really the person she seems to be It is certainly old Mombi said the guard who believed she was speaking the truth and then Jinjurs soldiers returned within the citys gates 252 The Sorceress quickly summoned the Scarecrow and his friends to her tent and began to question the supposed Mombi about the lost girl Ozma But Jellia knew nothing at all of this affair and presently she grew so nervous under the questioning that she gave way and began to weep to Glindas great astonishment Here is some foolish trickery said the Sorceress her eyes flashing with anger This is not Mombi at all but some other person who has been made to resemble her Tell me she demanded turning to the trembling girl what is your name This Jellia dared not tell having been threatened with death by the witch if she confessed the fraud But Glinda sweet and fair though she was understood magic better than any other person in the Land of Oz So by uttering a few potent words and making a peculiar gesture she quickly transformed the girl into her proper shape while at the same time old Mombi far away in Jinjurs palace suddenly resumed her own crooked form and evil features Why its Jellia Jamb cried the Scarecrow recognizing in the girl one of his old friends Its our interpreter said the Pumpkinhead smiling pleasantly Then Jellia was forced to tell of the trick Mombi 253 LineArt Drawing had played and she also begged Glindas protection which the Sorceress readily granted But Glinda was now really angry and sent word to Jinjur that the fraud was discovered and she must deliver up the real Mombi or suffer terrible consequences Jinjur was prepared for this message for the witch well understood when her natural form was thrust upon her that Glinda had discovered her trickery But the wicked old creature had already thought up a new deception and had made Jinjur promise to carry it out So the Queen said to Glindas messenger Tell your mistress that I cannot find Mombi anywhere but that Glinda is welcome to enter the 254 city and search herself for the old woman She may also bring her friends with her if she likes but if she does not find Mombi by sundown the Sorceress must promise to go away peaceably and bother us no more Glinda agreed to these terms well knowing that Mombi was somewhere within the city walls So Jinjur caused the gates to be thrown open and Glinda marched in at the head of a company of soldiers followed by the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman while Jack Pumpkinhead rode astride the SawHorse and the Educated Highly Magnified WoggleBug sauntered behind in a dignified manner Tip walked by the side of the Sorceress for Glinda had conceived a great liking for the boy Of course old Mombi had no intention of being found by Glinda so while her enemies were marching up the street the witch transformed herself into a red rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace It was a clever idea and a trick Glinda did not suspect so several precious hours were spent in a vain search for Mombi As sundown approached the Sorceress realized she had been defeated by the superior cunning of the aged witch so she gave the command to her people to march out of the
