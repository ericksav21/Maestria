ve the story But this copper man continued Dorothy looking at it with big eyes is not alive at all and I wonder what it was made for and why it was locked up in this queer place That is a mystery remarked the hen twisting her head to arrange her wingfeathers with her bill Dorothy stepped inside the little room to get a back view of the copper man and in this way discovered a printed card that hung between his shoulders it being suspended from a small copper peg at the back of his neck She unfastened this card and returned to the path where the light was better and sat herself down upon a slab of rock to read the printing What does it say asked the hen curiously Dorothy read the card aloud spelling out the big words with some difficulty and this is what she read SMITH TINKERS Patent DoubleAction ExtraResponsive ThoughtCreating PerfectTalking MECHANICAL MAN Fitted with our Special ClockWork Attachment Thinks Speaks Acts and Does Everything but Live Manufactured only at our Works at Evna Land of Ev All infringements will be promptly Prosecuted according to Law How queer said the yellow hen Do you think that is all true my dear I dont know answered Dorothy who had more to read Listen to this Billina DIRECTIONS FOR USING For THINKINGWind the Clockwork Man under his left arm marked No 1 For SPEAKINGWind the Clockwork Man under his right arm marked No 2 For WALKING and ACTIONWind Clockwork in the middle of his back marked No 3 N BThis Mechanism is guaranteed to work perfectly for a thousand years Well I declare gasped the yellow hen in amazement if the copper man can do half of these things he is a very wonderful machine But I suppose it is all humbug like so many other patented articles We might wind him up suggested Dorothy and see what hell do Where is the key to the clockwork asked Billina Hanging on the peg where I found the card Then said the hen let us try him and find out if he will go He is warranted for a thousand years it seems but we do not know how long he has been standing inside this rock Dorothy had already taken the clock key from the peg Which shall I wind up first she asked looking again at the directions on the card Number One I should think returned Billina That makes him think doesnt it Yes said Dorothy and wound up Number One under the left arm He doesnt seem any different remarked the hen critically Why of course not he is only thinking now said Dorothy I wonder what he is thinking about Ill wind up his talk and then perhaps he can tell us said the girl So she wound up Number Two and immediately the clockwork man said without moving any part of his body except his lips Good morning little girl Good morning Mrs Hen The words sounded a little hoarse and creaky and they were uttered all in the same tone without any change of expression whatever but both Dorothy and Billina understood them perfectly Good morning sir they answered politely Thank you for rescuing me continued the machine in the same monotonous voice which seemed to be worked by a bellows inside of him like the little toy lambs and cats the children squeeze so that they will make a noise Dont mention it answered Dorothy And then being very curious she asked How did you come to be locked up in this place It is a long story replied the copper man but I will tell it to you briefly I was purchased from Smith Tinker my manufacturers by a cruel King of Ev named Evoldo who used to beat all his servants until they died However he was not able to kill me because I was not alive and one must first live in order to die So that all his beating did me no harm and merely kept my copper body well polished This cruel king had a lovely wife and ten beautiful childrenfive boys and five girlsbut in a fit of anger he sold them all to the Nome King who by means of his magic arts changed them all into other forms and put them in his underground palace to ornament the rooms Afterward the King of Ev regretted his wicked action and tried to get his wife and children away from the Nome King but without avail So in despair he locked me up in this rock threw the key into the ocean and then jumped in after it and was drowned How very dreadful exclaimed Dorothy It is indeed said the machine When I found myself imprisoned I shouted for help until my voice ran down and then I walked back and forth in this little room until my action ran down and then I stood still and thought until my thoughts ran down After that I remember nothing until you wound me up again Its a very wonderful story said Dorothy and proves that the Land of Ev is really a fairy land as I thought it was Of course it is answered the copper man I do not suppose such a perfect machine as I am could be made in any place but a fairy land Ive never seen one in Kansas said Dorothy But where did you get the key to unlock this door asked the clockwork voice I found it on the shore where it was probly washed up by the waves she answered And now sir if you dont mind Ill wind up your action That will pleas
