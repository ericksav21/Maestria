ed so appetizing and delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed What is it do you spose The piglets had smelled the fruit quickly and before the girl could reach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had rushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness Its good anyway said Zeb or those little rascals wouldnt have gobbled it up so greedily Where are they asked Dorothy in astonishment They all looked around but the piglets had disappeared Dear me cried the Wizard they must have run away But I didnt see them go did you No replied the boy and the girl together Herepiggy piggy piggy called their master anxiously Several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet but the Wizard could not discover a single piglet Where are you he asked Why right beside you spoke a tiny voice Cant you see us No answered the little man in a puzzled tone We can see you said another of the piglets The Wizard stooped down and put out his hand and at once felt the small fat body of one of his pets He picked it up but could not see what he held It is very strange said he soberly The piglets have become invisible in some curious way Ill bet its because they ate that peach cried the kitten It wasnt a peach Eureka said Dorothy I only hope it wasnt poison It was fine Dorothy called one of the piglets Well eat all we can find of them said another But WE musnt eat them the Wizard warned the children or we too may become invisible and lose each other If we come across another of the strange fruit we must avoid it Calling the piglets to him he picked them all up one by one and put them away in his pocket for although he could not see them he could feel them and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe for the present The travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage which they presently reached It was a pretty place with vines growing thickly over the broad front porch The door stood open and a table was set in the front room with four chairs drawn up to it On the table were plates knives and forks and dishes of bread meat and fruits The meat was smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics and jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way But not a single person appeared to be in the room How funny exclaimed Dorothy who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood in the doorway A peal of merry laughter answered her and the knives and forks fell to the plates with a clatter One of the chairs pushed back from the table and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almost tempted to run away in fright Here are strangers mama cried the shrill and childish voice of some unseen person So I see my dear answered another voice soft and womanly What do you want demanded a third voice in a stern gruff accent Well well said the Wizard are there really people in this room Of course replied the mans voice Andpardon me for the foolish questionbut are you all invisible Surely the woman answered repeating her low rippling laughter Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe Why yes stammered the Wizard All the people I have ever met before were very plain to see Where do you come from then asked the woman in a curious tone We belong upon the face of the earth explained the Wizard but recently during an earthquake we fell down a crack and landed in the Country of the Mangaboos Dreadful creatures exclaimed the womans voice Ive heard of them They walled us up in a mountain continued the Wizard but we found there was a tunnel through to this side so we came here It is a beautiful place What do you call it It is the Valley of Voe Thank you We have seen no people since we arrived so we came to this house to enquire our way Are you hungry asked the womans voice I could eat something said Dorothy So could I added Zeb But we do not wish to intrude I assure you the Wizard hastened to say Thats all right returned the mans voice more pleasantly than before You are welcome to what we have As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action and Dorothy was sure they were in no danger among such lighthearted folks even if those folks couldnt be seen What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn enquired the mans voice Thats Jim said the girl Hes a horse What is he good for was the next question He draws the buggy you see fastened to him and we ride in the buggy instead of walking she explained Can he fight asked the mans voice No he can kick pretty hard with his heels and bite a little but Jim cant zactly fight she replied Then the bears will get him said one of the childrens voices Bears exclaimed Dorothy Are these bears here That is the one evil of our country answered the invisible man Many large and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe and when they can catch any of us they eat us up but as they cannot see us we seldom get caught Are the bears invisble too asked the girl Yes for
