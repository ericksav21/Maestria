ld follow us here went on Chalk Having been in existence only two days he knew little of Oz or geozophy He cant come here Skamperoo told him triumphantly Theres a deadly desert between Skampavia and Oz that no one in my fathers lifetime or in mine has ever crossed that is with the exception of ourselves and we were wished across which doesnt count Then as four footmen with heaping trays appeared he winked at Chalk and the white horse lapsed into a thoughtful silence And Skamperoo had been perfectly correct in his conjectures about Pinny Penny When with a resounding clunk the Kings gold crown had fallen upon the astonished Prime Minister his head had gone entirely through so he was forced to wear it much as a dog wears a collar But even so he was not slow to realize the significance of this odd happening or the power it brought with it Gripping the scepter which had forced itself into his hand he rushed into the throne room to find out what strange whim of his Master had made him acting King of the Realm A glance around the throne room was enough to show him that Skamperoo was not there and when he saw Matiah sitting so unconcernedly in the book alcove a sudden rage and conviction seized him Whatever had happened Matiah was to blame Leave this palace at once shouted Pinny Penny stamping first one foot and then the other At once do you hear or Ill call out the guard Matiah still deep in the History of Oz looked up in astonishment and when he saw the little Prime Minister wearing Skamperoos crown round his neck and brandishing his scepter he gave a perfect bellow of anger and dismay Wheres the King he roared looking wildly around the throne room And why are you wearing his crown Wheres Skamperoo C4 wherere the necklaces Ask yourself raged Pinny Penny shaking the scepter threateningly Everything was quiet and peaceful till you and your necklaces arrived at this palace theres some magic trickery about them and about you Dont think I was fooled by that horse story a horse does not appear out of the air Well now the Kings gone the horse is gone and unless you are gone in ten seconds Ill have you thrown out of the window Ten seconds do you hear This crown and scepter came to me through no wish or choice of my own but since they did come to me I AM THE KING And I intend to rule this country My first official act will be to rid myself of your filthy presence Now then start walking merchant and dont stop till you reach the border Twenty guards will follow to see you safely out of the country You wait till Skamperoo hears about this blustered Matiah backing away in alarm from the determined little Prime Minister Im more important to him than anyone else Then why arent you with him inquired Pinny Penny shrewdly No wherever hes gone he has gone without you I am the King and I do not need you so be off Clapping his hands Pinny gave a sharp command to the guards who came hurrying in answer to his summons Retiring rapidly to escape the tips of their sharp spikes Matiah sullenly began his long march It was nightfall by the time the little company reached the edge of Skampavia Here in a wilderness of rock and rubble the guardsmen left him with food enough for a couple of days and stern warnings never to return to Skampavia Far to the west the miserable merchant could see the comforting lights of Merryland but he had no desire to go there or east to the Kingdom of Ix Instead he stared hopelessly across the wilderness to where the heaving sands of the Deadly Desert gleamed like molten silver in the moonlight How had that rascally monarch ever escaped without his seeing him How could he ever safely cross the Deadly Desert and hope to reach Oz How had Skamperoo who seemed so dumb and foolish ever discovered the secret of using the magic emeralds when he himself had failed to do so How How How Crouched on a flat rock munching one of the sandwiches left by the guards Matiah scowled evilly across the grim desert his thoughts as treacherous and shifting as its deadly sands CHAPTER 15 THE DOONERS All day with only a short pause for lunch Pigasus had flown north Dorothy keeping a sharp lookout for Thunder Mountain or mountains of any sort but the wild desolate country through which they were flying was flat desertlike and apparently perfectly uninhabited A fine healthy chance we have of finding an army here snorted Pigasus as the afternoon drew to a hot weary close And what well do when we find Thunder Mountain I havent the faintest notion have you Even if I butt my nose black blue and blunt and you break both knuckles beating on its rocky exterior how can we ever hope to enter such a place much less release our unfortunate sovereigns I told you Kalico was a scoundrel Ill wager hes sent us on a wildgoose chase just to get us out of the way Ah dont say I told you so Theres always some way you know said Dorothy almost as downhearted as Pigasus though she would not admit it The pink pig rather ashamed of himself flew for several miles wit
