so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the Wicked Witch but Oz made no reply They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once but he did not They had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next The waiting was tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine oclock the next morning He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West and he did not wish to meet them again The four travelers passed a sleepless night each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow on him Dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in Kansas where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again Promptly at nine oclock the next morning the greenwhiskered soldier came to them and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room They kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take Presently they heard a solemn Voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said I am Oz the Great and Terrible Why do you seek me They looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one Dorothy asked Where are you I am everywhere answered the Voice but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible I will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me Indeed the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said We have come to claim our promise O Oz What promise asked Oz You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed said the girl And you promised to give me brains said the Scarecrow And you promised to give me a heart said the Tin Woodman And you promised to give me courage said the Cowardly Lion Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed asked the Voice and Dorothy thought it trembled a little Yes she answered I melted her with a bucket of water Dear me said the Voice how sudden Well come to me tomorrow for I must have time to think it over Youve had plenty of time already said the Tin Woodman angrily We shant wait a day longer said the Scarecrow You must keep your promises to us exclaimed Dorothy The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner As it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder For they saw standing in just the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were The Tin Woodman raising his axe rushed toward the little man and cried out Who are you I am Oz the Great and Terrible said the little man in a trembling voice But dont strike meplease dontand Ill do anything you want me to Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay I thought Oz was a great Head said Dorothy And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady said the Scarecrow And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast said the Tin Woodman And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire exclaimed the Lion No you are all wrong said the little man meekly I have been making believe Making believe cried Dorothy Are you not a Great Wizard Hush my dear he said Dont speak so loud or you will be overheardand I should be ruined Im supposed to be a Great Wizard And arent you she asked Not a bit of it my dear Im just a common man Youre more than that said the Scarecrow in a grieved tone youre a humbug Exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him I am a humbug But this is terrible said the Tin Woodman How shall I ever get my heart Or I my courage asked the Lion Or I my brains wailed the Scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve My dear friends said Oz I pray you not to speak of these little things Think of me and the terrible trouble Im in at being found out Doesnt anyone else know youre a humbug asked Dorothy No one knows it but you fourand myself replied Oz I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out It was a great mistake my
