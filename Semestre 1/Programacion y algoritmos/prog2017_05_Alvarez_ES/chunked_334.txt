ats and a BAH for an old Hoopadoop like YOU Hoopadoop repeated the Ox in a dazed whisper Do you mean to stand there and call the Royal Ox of Keretaria a Hoopadoop Yes said Mandy firmly but backing off a bit as she spoke What makes you think youre so much better than a goat even if you do talk put on airs and have golden horns Well and to Mandys surprise and relief Nox cleared his throat and grinned quite amiably after all I AM the Royal Ox you know more precious to the King than all his court and subjects Everyone jumps at my least command so why shouldnt I put on a few airs Besides do you think its polite to call me an old Hoopadoop when Ive just saved you from a dungeon No admitted Mandy resuming her seat thoughtfully I dont suppose it is Maybe you are as good as a goat she added with a little burst of generosity Oh thank you Thank you very much Through halfclosed eyes the Royal Ox looked quizzically at the Goat Girl I believe we shall get on famously mlass famously The truth is you amuse me no end and so long as you amuse me everything will be smooth as silk But of course if you bore me I will bore you Oh positively Lowering his head Nox shook his horns playfully Now I shouldnt try that if I were you advised Mandy raising her iron hand and cracking the fingers warningly For if you do I might throw things Ha ha I believe you would The enormous beast charmed by so much spirit and independence fairly beamed upon his new slave I take it you are pretty good at throwing things Yes and at catching them too Reaching up Mandy took seven of the dozen brushes off the shelf above her head Tossing them all into the air with three of her hands she caught them easily with the other four Then dragging her stool closer she began brushing the coat of her royal charge so hard and vigorously he blinked with pleasure and astonishment Will you have your tail plain curled or plaited asked Mandy in a businesslike voice ErC4erC4plain thank you With admiration and some alarm Nox regarded the whirling arms of the Goat Girl but the four little stable boys appearing at that moment stared at her in glassyeyed fright and consternation For Nox they had brought a tray heaped high with corn and oats and another with fresh sliced apples For Mandy there were two trays of gold dishes containing a sample of everything from the royal table Dropping her brushes Mandy seized all the trays at once in her various hands which so frightened the stable boys they took to their heels yelling at the tops of their voices Winking at the Royal Ox Mandy set his supper on the gold stand meant for that purpose then dropping to the floor before her own two trays began her first dinner in a strange land And WHAT a strange land mused Mandy helping herself from the gold dishes with first one hand and then another Well mlass inquired Nox daintily nibbling his oats and apples Is this not better than bread and water in a dungeon cell Too full for utterance Mandy rapturously nodded CHAPTER 4 THE MESSAGE IN THE HORN After the Goat Girl had finished her supper and the stable boys had hurried off with the trays Nox showed his new slave to her quarters Handy Mandy who had expected nothing better than a heap of straw in the corner of an empty stall decided that for a slave she was faring pretty well A small but complete apartment had been built in the wing next to Noxs stall with not only a comfortable bedroom and bath but a small sitting room as well The bed was a huge gold fourposter with blue silk sheets and comforters Never in her hard and simple life had Handy dreamed of such elegance Here try the chairs urged Nox trotting almost briskly into the sitting room This Mandy was only too willing to do and the pretty little room with its bookshelves lamps and pictures seemed to the honest Goat Girl much more desirable than the palace All belonged to Kerry mumbled the royal Ox settling himself largely on a white rug beside her Was Kerry one of your slaves asked Mandy rocking herself cheerfully to and fro with all her hands resting quietly in her lap SLAVE The Ox spoke sharply I should say not Kerry was a King Our own little King up to a few years ago and what a lad he was C4 what a lad Was exclaimed Mandy Why what happened to him He disappeared Nox told her sadly Nobody knows how or where just disappeared my girl on a hunting trip and this bluenosed scoundrel who claims to be his uncle came to rule over Keretaria Since then Nox lowered his voice cautiously everything is different C4 and changed The people are treated no better than dogs DOGS repeated the Royal Ox bitterly Of course this fellow cannot interfere with me or take any chances for there is a prophecy on the west wall of the castle that has stood for a thousand years What does it say asked Mandy leaning forward and clasping the arms of the rocker with all hands Impressively Nox repeated the prophecy So long as the Royal Ox of Keretaria is in good health and spirits so long and no longer shall the present King rul
