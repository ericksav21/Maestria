To My Readers Well my dears here is what you have asked for another Oz Book about Dorothys strange adventures Toto is in this story because you wanted him to be there and many other characters which you will recognize are in the story too Indeed the wishes of my little correspondents have been considered as carefully as possible and if the story is not exactly as you would have written it yourselves you must remember that a story has to be a story before it can be written down and the writer cannot change it much without spoiling it In the preface to Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz I said I would like to write some stories that were not Oz stories because I thought I had written about Oz long enough but since that volume was published I have been fairly deluged with letters from children imploring me to write more about Dorothy and more about Oz and since I write only to please the children I shall try to respect their wishes There are some new characters in this book that ought to win your love Im very fond of the shaggy man myself and I think you will like him too As for Polychromethe Rainbows Daughterand stupid little ButtonBright they seem to have brought a new element of fun into these Oz stories and I am glad I discovered them Yet I am anxious to have you write and tell me how you like them Since this book was written I have received some very remarkable News from The Land of Oz which has greatly astonished me I believe it will astonish you too my dears when you hear it But it is such a long and exciting story that it must be saved for another bookand perhaps that book will be the last story that will ever be told about the Land of Oz L FRANK BAUM Coronado 1909 1 The Way to Butterfield Please miss said the shaggy man can you tell me the road to Butterfield Dorothy looked him over Yes he was shaggy all right but there was a twinkle in his eye that seemed pleasant Oh yes she replied I can tell you But it isnt this road at all No You cross the tenacre lot follow the lane to the highway go north to the five branches and takelet me see To be sure miss see as far as Butterfield if you like said the shaggy man You take the branch next the willow stump I blieve or else the branch by the gopher holes or else Wont any of em do miss Course not Shaggy Man You must take the right road to get to Butterfield And is that the one by the gopher stump or Dear me cried Dorothy I shall have to show you the way youre so stupid Wait a minute till I run in the house and get my sunbonnet The shaggy man waited He had an oatstraw in his mouth which he chewed slowly as if it tasted good but it didnt There was an appletree beside the house and some apples had fallen to the ground The shaggy man thought they would taste better than the oatstraw so he walked over to get some A little black dog with bright brown eyes dashed out of the farmhouse and ran madly toward the shaggy man who had already picked up three apples and put them in one of the big wide pockets of his shaggy coat The little dog barked and made a dive for the shaggy mans leg but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in his big pocket along with the apples He took more apples afterward for many were on the ground and each one that he tossed into his pocket hit the little dog somewhere upon the head or back and made him growl The little dogs name was Toto and he was sorry he had been put in the shaggy mans pocket Pretty soon Dorothy came out of the house with her sunbonnet and she called out Come on Shaggy Man if you want me to show you the road to Butterfield She climbed the fence into the tenacre lot and he followed her walking slowly and stumbling over the little hillocks in the pasture as if he was thinking of something else and did not notice them My but youre clumsy said the little girl Are your feet tired No miss its my whiskers they tire very easily in this warm weather said he I wish it would snow dont you Course not Shaggy Man replied Dorothy giving him a severe look If it snowed in August it would spoil the corn and the oats and the wheat and then Uncle Henry wouldnt have any crops and that would make him poor and Never mind said the shaggy man It wont snow I guess Is this the lane Yes replied Dorothy climbing another fence Ill go as far as the highway with you Thankee miss youre very kind for your size Im sure said he gratefully It isnt everyone who knows the road to Butterfield Dorothy remarked as she tripped along the lane but Ive driven there many a time with Uncle Henry and so I blieve I could find it blindfolded Dont do that miss said the shaggy man earnestly you might make a mistake I wont she answered laughing Heres the highway Now its the secondno the third turn to the leftor else its the fourth Lets see The first one is by the elm tree and the second is by the gopher holes and then Then what he inquired putting his hands in his coat pockets Toto grabbed a finger and bit it the shaggy man took his hand out of that pocket quickly and said Oh Dorothy
