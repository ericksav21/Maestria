m but then they all stopped and stared into the domed cavern with faces of astonishment and dismay For the room was filled with the mailclad warriors of the Nome King rank after rank standing in orderly array The electric lights upon their brows gleamed brightly their battleaxes were poised as if to strike down their foes yet they remained motionless as statues awaiting the word of command And in the center of this terrible army sat the little King upon his throne of rock But he neither smiled nor laughed Instead his face was distorted with rage and most dreadful to behold 17 The Scarecrow Wins the Fight After Billina had entered the palace Dorothy and Evring sat down to await the success or failure of her mission and the Nome King occupied his throne and smoked his long pipe for a while in a cheerful and contented mood Then the bell above the throne which sounded whenever an enchantment was broken began to ring and the King gave a start of annoyance and exclaimed Rockettyricketts When the bell rang a second time the King shouted angrily Smudge and blazes and at a third ring he screamed in a fury Hippikaloric which must be a dreadful word because we dont know what it means After that the bell went on ringing time after time but the King was now so violently enraged that he could not utter a word but hopped out of his throne and all around the room in a mad frenzy so that he reminded Dorothy of a jumpingjack The girl was for her part filled with joy at every peal of the bell for it announced the fact that Billina had transformed one more ornament into a living person Dorothy was also amazed at Billinas success for she could not imagine how the yellow hen was able to guess correctly from all the bewildering number of articles clustered in the rooms of the palace But after she had counted ten and the bell continued to ring she knew that not only the royal family of Ev but Ozma and her followers also were being restored to their natural forms and she was so delighted that the antics of the angry King only made her laugh merrily Perhaps the little monarch could not be more furious than he was before but the girls laughter nearly drove him frantic and he roared at her like a savage beast Then as he found that all his enchantments were likely to be dispelled and his victims every one set free he suddenly ran to the little door that opened upon the balcony and gave the shrill whistle that summoned his warriors At once the army filed out of the gold and silver doors in great numbers and marched up a winding stairs and into the throne room led by a stern featured Nome who was their captain When they had nearly filled the throne room they formed ranks in the big underground cavern below and then stood still until they were told what to do next Dorothy had pressed back to one side of the cavern when the warriors entered and now she stood holding little Prince Evrings hand while the great Lion crouched upon one side and the enormous Tiger crouched on the other side Seize that girl shouted the King to his captain and a group of warriors sprang forward to obey But both the Lion and Tiger snarled so fiercely and bared their strong sharp teeth so threateningly that the men drew back in alarm Dont mind them cried the Nome King they cannot leap beyond the places where they now stand But they can bite those who attempt to touch the girl said the captain Ill fix that answered the King Ill enchant them again so that they cant open their jaws He stepped out of the throne to do this but just then the Sawhorse ran up behind him and gave the fat monarch a powerful kick with both his wooden hind legs Ow Murder Treason yelled the King who had been hurled against several of his warriors and was considerably bruised Who did that I did growled the Sawhorse viciously You let Dorothy alone or Ill kick you again Well see about that replied the King and at once he waved his hand toward the Sawhorse and muttered a magical word Aha he continued NOW let us see you move you wooden mule But in spite of the magic the Sawhorse moved and he moved so quickly toward the King that the fat little man could not get out of his way ThumpBANG came the wooden heels right against his round body and the King flew into the air and fell upon the head of his captain who let him drop flat upon the ground Well well said the King sitting up and looking surprised Why didnt my magic belt work I wonder The creature is made of wood replied the captain Your magic will not work on wood you know Ah Id forgotten that said the King getting up and limping to his throne Very well let the girl alone She cant escape us anyway The warriors who had been rather confused by these incidents now formed their ranks again and the Sawhorse pranced across the room to Dorothy and took a position beside the Hungry Tiger At that moment the doors that led to the palace flew open and the people of Ev and the people of Oz were disclosed to view They paused astonished at sight of the warriors an
