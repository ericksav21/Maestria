 It was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny In a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly Make yourself perfectly at home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell Oz will send for you tomorrow morning She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others These she also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning It would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute The next morning after breakfast the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Totos neck and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court all dressed in rich costumes These people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning although they were never permitted to see Oz As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible Of course answered the girl if he will see me Oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard although he does not like to have people ask to see him Indeed at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from Then he asked me what you looked like and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence Just then a bell rang and the green girl said to Dorothy That is the signal You must go into the Throne Room alone She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place It was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together In the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else In the center of the chair was an enormous Head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever There was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily Then the mouth moved and Dorothy heard a voice say I am Oz the Great and Terrible Who are you and why do you seek me It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head so she took courage and answered I am Dorothy the Small and Meek I have come to you for help The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute Then said the voice Where did you get the silver shoes I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East when my house fell on her and killed her she replied Where did you get the mark upon your forehead continued the voice That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me goodbye and sent me to you said the girl Again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth Then Oz asked What do you wish me to do Send me back to Kansas where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are she answered earnestly I dont like your country although it is so beautiful And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long The eyes winked three times and then they turne
