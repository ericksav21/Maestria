ek youve grown Why shouldnt I asked the hen in a sharp clear voice I live on the fat of the landdont I Ozma You have everything you wish for said the Princess Around Billinas neck was a string of beautiful pearls and on her legs were bracelets of emeralds She nestled herself comfortably in Dorothys lap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with a sharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow But the little girl gave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down again without daring to scratch How horrid of you Eureka cried Dorothy Is that the way to treat my friends You have queer friends seems to me replied the kitten in a surly tone Seems to me the same way said Billina scornfully if that beastly cat is one of them Look here said Dorothy sternly I wont have any quarrelling in the Land of Oz I can tell you Everybody lives in peace here and loves everybody else and unless you two Billina and Eureka make up and be friends Ill take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again IMMEJITLY So there They were both much frightened at the threat and promised meekly to be good But it was never noticed that they became very warm friends for all of that And now the Tin Woodman arrived his body most beautifully nickleplated so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of the room The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly and welcomed with joy the return of the little old Wizard Sir said he to the latter I never can thank you enough for the excellent heart you once gave me It has made me many friends I assure you and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it every did Im glad to hear that said the Wizard I was afraid it would get moldy in that tin body of yours Not at all returned Nick Chopper It keeps finely being preserved in my airtight chest Zeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people but they were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them very much even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen But he became nervous again when the next visitor was announced This said Princess Ozma is my friend Mr H M WoggleBug T E who assisted me one time when I was in great distress and is now the Dean of the Royal College of Athletic Science Ah said the Wizard Im pleased to meet so distinguished a personage H M said the WoggleBug pompously means Highly Magnified and T E means Thoroughly Educated I am in reality a very big bug and doubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain How well you disguise it said the Wizard But I dont doubt your word in the least Nobody doubts it sir replied the WoggleBug and drawing a book from its pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and sat down in a corner to read Nobody minded this rudeness which might have seemed more impolite in one less thoroughly educated so they straightway forgot him and joined in a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bedtime arrived 16 Jim The CabHorse Jim the Cabhorse found himself in possession of a large room with a green marble floor and carved marble wainscoting which was so stately in its appearance that it would have awed anyone else Jim accepted it as a mere detail and at his command the attendants gave his coat a good rubbing combed his mane and tail and washed his hoofs and fetlocks Then they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied that they could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience First they brought him a steaming bowl of soup which the horse eyed in dismay Take that stuff away he commanded Do you take me for a salamander They obeyed at once and next served a fine large turbot on a silver platter with drawn gravy poured over it Fish cried Jim with a sniff Do you take me for a tomcat Away with it The servants were a little discouraged but soon they brought in a great tray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast Well well said the horse now thoroughly provoked Do you take me for a weasel How stupid and ignorant you are in the Land of Oz and what dreadful things you feed upon Is there nothing that is decent to eat in this palace The trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward who came in haste and said What would your Highness like for dinner Highness repeated Jim who was unused to such titles You are at least six feet high and that is higher than any other animal in this country said the Steward Well my Highness would like some oats declared the horse Oats We have no whole oats the Steward replied with much deference But there is any quantity of oatmeal which we often cook for breakfast Oatmeal is a breakfast dish added the Steward humbly Ill make it a dinner dish said Jim Fetch it on but dont cook it as you value your life You see the respect shown the wornout old cabhorse made him a little arrogant and he forgot he was a guest never having been treated otherwise than as a servant since the day he was born until his arrival in the Land of Oz But the royal attendants did not heed the animals
