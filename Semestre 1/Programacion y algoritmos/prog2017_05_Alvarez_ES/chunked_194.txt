 the shaggy man That is true said the King looking at him carefully but perhaps you are not civilized After a sound sleep and a good nights rest they had their breakfast with the King and then bade his Majesty goodbye Youve been kind to uscept poor ButtonBright said Dorothy and weve had a nice time in Foxville Then said King Dox perhaps youll be good enough to get me an invitation to Princess Ozmas birthday celebration Ill try she promised if I see her in time Its on the twentyfirst remember he continued and if youll just see that Im invited Ill find a way to cross the Dreadful Desert into the marvelous Land of Oz Ive always wanted to visit the Emerald City so Im sure it was fortunate you arrived here just when you did you being Princess Ozmas friend and able to assist me in getting the invitation If I see Ozma Ill ask her to invite you she replied The FoxKing had a delightful luncheon put up for them which the shaggy man shoved in his pocket and the foxcaptain escorted them to an arch at the side of the village opposite the one by which they had entered Here they found more soldiers guarding the road Are you afraid of enemies asked Dorothy No because we are watchful and able to protect ourselves answered the captain But this road leads to another village peopled by big stupid beasts who might cause us trouble if they thought we were afraid of them What beasts are they asked the shaggy man The captain hesitated to answer Finally he said You will learn all about them when you arrive at their city But do not be afraid of them ButtonBright is so wonderfully clever and has now such an intelligent face that Im sure he will manage to find a way to protect you This made Dorothy and the shaggy man rather uneasy for they had not so much confidence in the foxboys wisdom as the captain seemed to have But as their escort would say no more about the beasts they bade him goodbye and proceeded on their journey 5 The Rainbows Daughter Toto now allowed to run about as he pleased was glad to be free again and able to bark at the birds and chase the butterflies The country around them was charming yet in the pretty fields of wildflowers and groves of leafy trees were no houses whatever or sign of any inhabitants Birds flew through the air and cunning white rabbits darted amongst the tall grasses and green bushes Dorothy noticed even the ants toiling busily along the roadway bearing gigantic loads of clover seed but of people there were none at all They walked briskly on for an hour or two for even little ButtonBright was a good walker and did not tire easily At length as they turned a curve in the road they beheld just before them a curious sight A little girl radiant and beautiful shapely as a fairy and exquisitely dressed was dancing gracefully in the middle of the lonely road whirling slowly this way and that her dainty feet twinkling in sprightly fashion She was clad in flowing fluffy robes of soft material that reminded Dorothy of woven cobwebs only it was colored in soft tintings of violet rose topaz olive azure and white mingled together most harmoniously in stripes which melted one into the other with soft blendings Her hair was like spun gold and flowed around her in a cloud no strand being fastened or confined by either pin or ornament or ribbon Filled with wonder and admiration our friends approached and stood watching this fascinating dance The girl was no taller than Dorothy although more slender nor did she seem any older than our little heroine Suddenly she paused and abandoned the dance as if for the first time observing the presence of strangers As she faced them shy as a frightened fawn poised upon one foot as if to fly the next instant Dorothy was astonished to see tears flowing from her violet eyes and trickling down her lovely rosehued cheeks That the dainty maiden should dance and weep at the same time was indeed surprising so Dorothy asked in a soft sympathetic voice Are you unhappy little girl Very was the reply I am lost Why so are we said Dorothy smiling but we dont cry about it Dont you Why not Cause Ive been lost before and always got found again answered Dorothy simply But Ive never been lost before murmured the dainty maiden and Im worried and afraid You were dancing remarked Dorothy in a puzzled tone of voice Oh that was just to keep warm explained the maiden quickly It was not because I felt happy or gay I assure you Dorothy looked at her closely Her gauzy flowing robes might not be very warm yet the weather wasnt at all chilly but rather mild and balmy like a spring day Who are you dear she asked gently Im Polychrome was the reply Polly whom Polychrome Im the Daughter of the Rainbow Oh said Dorothy with a gasp I didnt know the Rainbow had children But I MIGHT have known it before you spoke You couldnt really be anything else Why not inquired Polychrome as if surprised Because youre so lovely and sweet The little maiden smiled through her tears came up to Dorothy and placed her slender fingers
