 feathers Kabumpo C4 imagine that And taller than I am too Well theres no harm in feathers observed Kabumpo jocularly Pick a plume for your bonnet my child The girls in our countries adorn themselves with these pretty fripperies Ive even worn them myself at court functions he admitted selfconsciously But do you think you can hold the colts head up as we go through Burnt feathers smell rather awful and we dont wish to anger the owner or spoil his crop A bit confused by the words owner and crop Planetty nevertheless caught the idea and explained it so cleverly to Thun the Thunder Colt started through the field holding his head high and handsome so that the flames spurted upward and not down It was rather like plowing through a wheat field decided Randy as Kabumpo treading lightly as he could stepped after Thun It was though more like a sea of waving plumes endlessly bending nodding and rippling in the wind Planetty gathered armfuls of these bright and newest treasures liking them almost as much as the flowers in the forest Thun for his part found the whole experience irksome in the extreme These pink feathers give me the big pain in the neck he puffed up indignantly as he trotted along with his head in the air Planetty reading his message with a little smile was astonished to hear a series of roars and explosions behind her Surely Thuns remarks were not as funny as all that Turning round she was shocked to see Kabumpo swaying and stumbling in his tracks coughing and spluttering and torn by such gigantic guffaws he had already shaken Randy from his back The young King himself rolled and twisted on the ground fairly gasping for breath Its the feathers he gasped weakly as Planetty leaping off the Thunder Colt ran back to investigate Theyre tickling us to death Get away quickly Netty dear before they get you C4 Oh ha ha HAH Oh ho ho Quick Before it is too late Oh hi hi hi I shall die laughing To the startled little Princess he appeared to be dying already No no Please not she cried dropping her armful of feathers With surprising strength she jerked Randy upright and in spite of his continued roars and wild writhings managed to fling him across Thuns back Now Kabumpo was down kicking and rolling hysterically It seemed to Planetty that the feathers were wickedly alive and tickling them on purpose They tossed swayed and brushed against her and Thun too but having no effect on the metallic skin of the Nuthers curled away in distaste Stop Stop I hate you screamed Planetty stamping on the bunch she had picked a moment before then struggling in vain to pull Kabumpo up by his trunk Thun Thun What shall we do Racing back to the Thunder Colt Planetty tapped out all that was happening to their best and only friends holding the convulsed and still laughing Randy in place with one hand as she did so Thun from anxious glances over his shoulder had guessed more than half the difficulty Search in the Kabumptys pocket for something to tie round him so I may pull him out of the feathers flashed the Thunder Colt swinging in a circle to prance and stamp on the plumes still curling down to tickle the helpless boy on his back Feeling in Kabumpos pockets as he tossed and lashed about was hard enough but Planetty who was quick and clever soon found a long stout heavily linked gold chain Kabumpo twisted round and round his neck on important occasions Slipping the chain through his belt the little Princess clasped the other ends round the Thunder Colts chest making a strong and splendid harness Then mounting quickly and holding desperately to Randy Planetty gave the signal for Thun to start And away through the deadly field charged the nightblack steed burning feathers left and right with his flashing breath and dragging Kabumpo along as easily as if he had been a sack of potatoes instead of a twoton elephant The feathers bending beneath made the going soft so that the Elegant Elephant did not suffer so much as a scratch and Thun galloped so swiftly that in less than ten minutes they had reached the other side of the beautiful but treacherous field Going half a mile beyond Thun came to an anxious halt the golden chain falling slack around his ankles while Planetty jumped down to see how Kabumpo was doing The Elegant Elephant had stopped laughing but his eyes still rolled and his muscles still twitched and rippled from the terrible tickling he had endured Randy exhausted and weak hung like a dummy stuffed with straw over the Thunder Colts back Oh we were too late too long mourned Planetty wringing her hands and running distractedly between the Elegant Elephant and the insensible King Oh my netness they will become stiff and still as Nuthers deprived of their springs she tapped out dolefully to Thun Do not be too sure The Thunder Colt puffed out his message slowly See already the big Kabumpty is trying to rise And such indeed was the case Astonished and mortified to find himself stretched on the ground in broad daylight and still too confus
