 Authors Note After the publication of The Wonderful Wizard of OZ I began to receive letters from children telling me of their pleasure in reading the story and asking me to write something more about the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman At first I considered these little letters frank and earnest though they were in the light of pretty compliments but the letters continued to come during succeeding months and even years Finally I promised one little girl who made a long journey to see me and prefer her requestand she is a Dorothy by the waythat when a thousand little girls had written me a thousand little letters asking for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman I would write the book Either little Dorothy was a fairy in disguise and waved her magic wand or the success of the stage production of The Wizard of OZ made new friends for the story For the thousand letters reached their destination long sinceand many more followed them And now although pleading guilty to long delay I have kept my promise in this book L FRANK BAUM Chicago June 1904 To those excellent good fellows and comedians David C Montgomery and Frank A Stone whose clever personations of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow have delighted thousands of children throughout the land this book is gratefully dedicated by THE AUTHOR LIST OF CHAPTERS PAGE Tip Manufactures Pumpkinhead 7 The Marvelous Powder of Life 15 The Flight of the Fugitives 29 Tip Makes an Experiment in Magic 39 The Awakening of the Sawhorse 47 Jack Pumpkinheads Ride to the Emerald City 59 His Majesty the Scarecrow 71 Gen Jinjurs Army of Revolt 83 The Scarecrow Plans an escape 97 The Journey to the Tin Woodman 109 A NickelPlated Emperor 121 Mr H M WoggleBug T E 135 A Highly Magnified History 147 Old Mombi indulges in Witchcraft 159 The Prisoners of the Queen 169 The Scarecrow Takes Time to Think 181 The Astonishing Flight of the Gump 191 In the Jackdaws Nest 201 Dr Nikidiks Famous Wishing Pills 219 The Scarecrow Appeals to Glinda the Good 231 The TinWoodman Plucks a Rose 247 The Transformation of Old Mombi 257 Princess Ozma of Oz 265 The Riches of Content 279 7 Tip Manufactures a Pumpkinhead In the Country of the Gillikins which is at the North of the Land of Oz lived a youth called Tip There was more to his name than that for old Mombi often declared that his whole name was Tippetarius but no one was expected to say such a long word when Tip would do just as well This boy remembered nothing of his parents for he had been brought when quite young to be reared by the old woman known as Mombi whose reputation I am sorry to say was none of the best For the Gillikin people had reason to suspect her of indulging in magical arts and therefore hesitated to associate with her Mombi was not exactly a Witch because the Good Witch who ruled that part of the Land of Oz 8 LineArt Drawing had forbidden any other Witch to exist in her dominions So Tips guardian however much she might aspire to working magic realized it was unlawful to be more than a Sorceress or at most a Wizardess Tip was made to carry wood from the forest that the old woman might boil her pot He also worked in the cornfields hoeing and husking and he fed the pigs and milked the fourhorned cow that was Mombis especial pride But you must not suppose he worked all the time for he felt that would be bad for him When sent to the forest Tip often climbed trees for birds eggs or amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or fishing in the brooks with bent pins Then he would hastily gather his armful of wood and carry it home And when he was supposed to be working in the cornfields and the tall stalks hid him from Mombis view Tip would often dig in the gopher holes or if the mood seized him 9 lie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a nap So by taking care not to exhaust his strength he grew as strong and rugged as a boy may be Mombis curious magic often frightened her neighbors and they treated her shyly yet respectfully because of her weird powers But Tip frankly hated her and took no pains to hide his feelings Indeed he sometimes showed less respect for the old woman than he should have done considering she was his guardian There were pumpkins in Mombis cornfields lying golden red among the rows of green stalks and these had been planted and carefully tended that the fourhorned cow might eat of them in the winter time But one day after the corn had all been cut and stacked and Tip was carrying the pumpkins to the stable he took a notion to make a Jack Lantern and try to give the old woman a fright with it So he selected a fine big pumpkinone with a lustrous orangered colorand began carving it With the point of his knife he made two round eyes a threecornered nose and LineArt Drawing 10 a mouth shaped like a new moon The face when completed could not have been considered strictly beautiful but it wore a smile so big and broad and was so jolly in expression that even Tip laughed as he looked admiringly at his work The child had
