cant work for a witch without learning good magic But now since everything is turning out so splendidly Ill just go back to my tree stump One two three back to my tree But what became of the witch cried Ozma catching hold of the dwarfs purple beard for his head had already vanished Ha ha She exploded and popped off roared a voice from the place where the elfs head had been I told her not to eat those jumping beans And after that I buried her hammer in the garden of Keretaria and there it stayed till Handy plowed it up Goodbye all And the body of the hammer elf melted into nothing and was gone MyC4y what a clever fellow chuckled Handy So now Wutz and Ruggedo are a couple of cactuses MmC4mmm MmmmC4mm Unpleasant to the last Do you suppose anyone can ever disenchant them For goatness sake be careful begged Handy as Jellia in answer to her Mistress ring came to carry the plants to the conservatory Whatever you do dont drop em And to think that the Wizard is potted himself Well Ill never have a hand in breaking his enchantment I never thought anyone could ever break Ruggedos enchantment confessed Ozma When I changed him to a jug I commanded him to keep that shape till he was broken by the seventh hand of a traveling Mernite And at that time I did not even know there was such a place as Mt Mern or a clever Goat Girl like Handy But arent you glad there was shouted the little Wizard of Oz tossing up his hat and catching it on his nose Arent we all glad to know Handy Mandy Nox and this jolly young King Long live the Royal Ox and the Little King of Keretaria cried the cheering Ozites Long live Handy Mandy the sevenarmed wonder of the world and OZ And of course they will live long everyone lives long in Oz But even if Handy lives to be a hundred she will never forget the grand banquet given that evening in her honor Besides the famous people she already knew the Goat Girl was presented to all the other celebrities at Ozmas court and shaking hands with them heartily and seven at a time she had never been so flattered and fussed over in her life Nox and Kerry came in for their share of honors too There was nothing the Ozians would not have done for their three new friends and rescuers Ozma overwhelmed by Handys generosity in giving her the silver hammer and already indebted to her for saving the Kingdom racked her brains for some wonderful gift to reward the brave mountain lass But it was Nox who solved the difficulty by confiding to Ozma that Handy desired more than anything else a set of gloves for her hands It seemed she had never had enough gloves for more than two at a time So smiling secretly to herself Ozma gave the Goat Girl seven sets of fine kid gloves and an emerald necklace that wound three times round her sturdy neck With the necklace a complete new outfit and her fortynine gloves Handy Mandy felt herself quite ready for high life and royal society Though you really should wear a boxing glove on that iron hand whispered the Scarecrow as Handy blushingly resumed her seat after Ozmas speech of presentation Stay in the Emerald City and we will make you a general in the army promised the straw man earnestly But Handy shook her head with tears of merriment in her eyes Though she never quite forgave Scraps for pushing her over she and the Scarecrow were already as friendly and easy as an old pair of shoes Handy Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday the straw man had nicknamed her because she had a hand for every day in the week Nox had insisted on Himself being invited to the banquet and the clever elf added much to the pleasure and hilarity of that memorable occasion Indeed many times afterward when she felt bored or lonely Ozma would summon Himself just to amuse and cheer her up The silver hammer was stored away with the other important magic treasures and is regarded by many as the most powerful magic in the castle Handy Mandy kept the blue flower to help her on future journeys and after she and her two friends had spent a happy week in the Emerald City Ozma reluctantly wished Kerry and Nox to Keretaria and the Goat Girl back to Mt Mern There for a month Handy Mandy astonished the villagers with the story of her travels then gathering up her goats she took herself and them by a fast wishing pill the Wizard had given her to the Kingdom of Keretaria As the Goat Girls hands retained all of their strength and willingness and Noxs horns all their magic C4 even to giving wise and useful messages C4 these two and little Kerry ruled the Kingdom between them with such skill and cleverness that everyone was enormously happy and prosperous THE END
