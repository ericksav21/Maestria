e When a green dog ran out and barked at them the Saw Horse promptly kicked at it with its wooden leg and sent the little animal howling into one of the houses but nothing more serious than this happened to interrupt their progress to the royal palace The Pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight into the Scarecrows presence but the soldier would not permit that So Jack dismounted with much difficulty and a servant led the SawHorse around to the rear while the Soldier with the Green Whiskers escorted the Pumpkinhead into the palace by the front entrance The stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the soldier went to announce him It so happened that at this hour His Majesty was at leisure and greatly bored for want of something to do so he ordered his visitor to be shown at once into his throne room Jack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this magnificent city for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs But when he en 70 tered the room and saw for the first time His Majesty the Scarecrow seated upon his glittering throne he stopped short in amazement LineArt Drawing 71 His Majesty the Scarecrow I suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is but Jack Pumpkinhead never having seen such a creation was more surprised at meeting the remarkable King of the Emerald City than by any other one experience of his brief life His Majesty the Scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes and his head was merely a small sack stuffed with straw upon which eyes ears a nose and a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a face The clothes were also stuffed with straw and that so unevenly or carelessly that his Majestys legs and arms seemed more bumpy than was necessary Upon his hands were gloves with long fingers and these were padded with cotton Wisps of straw stuck out from the monarchs 72 coat and also from his neck and boottops Upon his head he wore a heavy golden crown set thick with sparkling jewels and the weight of this crown caused his brow to sag in wrinkles giving a thoughtful expression to the painted face Indeed the crown alone betokened majesty in all else the Scarecrow King was but a simple scarecrowflimsy awkward and unsubstantial But if the strange appearance of his Majesty the Scarecrow seemed startling to Jack no less wonderful was the form of the Pumpkinhead to the Scarecrow The purple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt hung loosely over the wooden joints Tip had manufactured and the carved face on the pumpkin grinned perpetually as if its wearer considered life the jolliest thing imaginable At first indeed His Majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at him and was inclined to resent such a liberty but it was not without reason that the Scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the wisest personage in the Land of Oz He made a more careful examination of his visitor and soon discovered that Jacks features were carved into a smile and that he could not look grave if he wished to The King was the first to speak After regarding 73 LineArt Drawing Jack for some minutes he said in a tone of wonder Where on earth did you come from and how do you happen to be alive I beg your Majestys pardon returned the Pumpkinhead but I do not understand you 74 What dont you understand asked the Scarecrow Why I dont understand your language You see I came from the Country of the Gillikins so that I am a foreigner Ah to be sure exclaimed the Scarecrow I myself speak the language of the Munchkins which is also the language of the Emerald City But you I suppose speak the language of the Pumpkinheads Exactly so your Majesty replied the other bowing so it will be impossible for us to understand one another That is unfortunate certainly said the Scarecrow thoughtfully We must have an interpreter What is an interpreter asked Jack A person who understands both my language and your own When I say anything the interpreter can tell you what I mean and when you say anything the interpreter can tell me what you mean For the interpreter can speak both languages as well as understand them That is certainly clever said Jack greatly pleased at finding so simple a way out of the difficulty So the Scarecrow commanded the Soldier with the Green Whiskers to search among his people 75 until he found one who understood the language of the Gillikins as well as the language of the Emerald City and to bring that person to him at once When the Soldier had departed the Scarecrow said Wont you take a chair while we are waiting Your Majesty forgets that I cannot understand you replied the Pumpkinhead If you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to do so The Scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to a position behind the Pumpkinhead Then he gave Jack a sudden push that sent him sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up like a jackknife and had hard work to untangle himself Did you unde
