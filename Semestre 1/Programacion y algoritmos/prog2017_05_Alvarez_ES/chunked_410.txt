e rocketing of the plane the Tin Woodman could see a tall green figure sprawled across the navigators table As he had bent over to examine the Oztobers steering apparatus the Soldier with Green Whiskers had been taken with a violent cramp from the twentynine pickles he had eaten at the party Falling heavily on the board he had pushed down ten of the Wizards brightcolored buttons Following the directions of all ten one after the other the Oztober had exploded into the air and now whistling and whirling like a comet bound for Mars was charging into the Heavens Jellia Jam was too bruised and shaken to do anything but cling to the side of one of the seats The Soldier after his head had been whacked down three times on the board had lapsed into complete and utter silence Only Nick managed to preserve a semblance of his usual calm and composure Though severely dented by the planes takeoff the Tin Woodman being of metal felt no pain Nor was he subject to the giddiness that assailed ordinary flesh and bone bodies under such trying conditions Even standing on his head did not greatly inconvenience him and after the first dreadful shock he began to perceive a certain order and rhythm in their flight This was not strange The Soldiers fall had pressed down the button to inflate the Oztobers balloon the Up and the South buttons the fast spin spiral zig zag slow and circle buttons as well So first the Oztober would shoot straight up then it would go into a fast spin and spiral The zigs and zags were a little less terrible and on one of the slow circles the Tin Woodman managed to extricate his foot from the luggage rack Clattering full length in the aisle he lay still till the next slow circle Then leaping to his feet he rushed forward and pulled the Soldier off the steering board He had just time to prop the unconscious army into the third chair and fall into the pilots seat himself when the Oztober went into another fast spin and spiral This rather upset Nick He had taken a hasty look at the navigators table when he entered the ship and then more interested in the metal of which the plane was constructed had gone tapping about testing it with his tin knuckles intending to return to the steering gear later He naturally had supposed that when he pulled the soldier off the board the plane would slow down or change its course But nothing of the kind happened All the buttons the soldier had fallen on stayed down Grasping the wheel Nick was relieved to find he could steady the Oztober a bit in this way Holding to it with one hand he tried to pull out the spin and spiral buttons with the other But even his strong tin fingers could not budge them Next he glanced frantically over the board for a stop or down button but the down button when he found it filled him with apprehension If they shot downward at the speed they were hurling upward the plane most certainly would be wrecked No decided Nick drawing his fingers hastily back from the down button they were much safer in the air until he learned a little more about flying and hed just have to hang on till he discovered how the Ozoplane worked Grasping the wheel resignedly in both hands he glanced back to see how Jellia was faring Jellia was sitting dizzily in the middle of the aisle But she was so encouraged to see Nick actually at the wheel that she made her way to him and hung firmly to the arm of his chair Just then the Oztober whirled into its twentieth spin and spiral and Jellia C4 dislodged from the chair C4 caught at the steering table to save herself from falling Oh now youve done it gasped Nick as the Oztober gave a wicked lurch Oh nowFF20C4 His voice trailed off into a hoarse squeak for as abruptly as it had started the plane stopped and held aloft by its stillbuoyant balloon swung easily to and fro in the faint wind that stirred above the clouds Say How did you do it Letting go the wheel the Tin Woodman seized Jellia by the shoulders What panted Jellia What did I do Why you saved the ship You stopped her See all the buttons are up again Removing Jellias clutching fingers gently from the table top Nick discovered a flat bar on the underside of the board As soon as Jellia pressed the bar all the buttons had popped back to their normal position So THATS it exclaimed Nick rubbing his tin forehead anxiously Each time you want to change the course you press this bar and then begin all over again But now were sinking groaned Jellia And sinking herself into the seat back of Nick she stared at him with round desperate eyes Sinking are we Well Ill soon put a stop to that Pouncing on the green button to inflate the Oztobers gas bag Nick pressed it quickly for of course as soon as Jellia had touched the bar the buttons had all sprung up and the magic gas had begun to seep out of the planes balloon attachment As it again filled and became taut the slow downward drift of the ship ceased and again it hung motionless between a cloud and a star Now breathed the Tin Woodman eyeing the
