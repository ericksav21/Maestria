 to Ozma We want Azarine to stay here a long time dont we Jellia Come on Azzy dear Ill lend you an old dress and well all go for a ride before lunch You on Shaggy Jellia and I on Dear Deer Bettsy and Trot on the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow on the Hungry Tiger Its all right go ahead Ozma nodded indulgently as the little Princess hung back She did want so much to stay and meet all the interesting people in the garden but she felt it her real duty to return to her subjects now suffering under the cruel rule and temper of Bustabo Then Ive already turned Bustabo into a red Squirrel Ozma told the Princess gravely In that form he still can enjoy himself but do no harm to others Ive also sent a message saying you will be home in a few days and placed Archibald the Archer in charge till you return Oh how did you know Archy is the one I trust most marveled Azarine her eyes shining with happiness and astonishment Bustabo threw Archy into a dungeon a week ago because he tried to help me Ozma knows everything confided Dorothy with an adoring glance toward the little Ruler of all Oz And everythings going to be lovely Come on Azzy Ill beat you to the fountain in the garden So now with her last worry removed the little Princess of Red Top skipped off with Dorothy to meet all the exciting celebrities in the garden The two deer alarmed by the strange appearance of some of the Ozlanders had hidden themselves in a snowball bush But Azarine soon coaxed them out and in no time at all they were chatting like old friends with the Hungry Tiger and the Saw Horse Jellia stayed in the garden only a short while for Jellia had other things to do The little Oz Maid was determined to have a party to celebrate their homecoming and soon in deep conference with the castle chef she was planning the most gorgeous feast the Green Castle ever had known It began at noon and lasted till nightfall Even long after the tall candles had burned low the cheery company sat around the royal table while Dorothy Jellia and the Scarecrow told and retold their amazing adventures in the Strat and on Red Top Mountain So delightful did Azarine and the two Deer find life in the capitol they stayed on and on Each evening the girls and Ozma and her most important counselor would gather in her private sitting room There looking at the magic screen they followed the progress of Nick and the Wizard as they flew on and on through the strange Highways and Byways of the Stratosphere What a story they will have to tell us when they return WHAT a story THE END
