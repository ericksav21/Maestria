rted walking stolidly through the forest Never had Dorothy felt so blue C4 or rather so black and blue C4 so wet so discouraged so thoroughly miserable And when sticking out her tongue to see if it was still pink she discovered that it too was black she began sobbing softly to herself No one will know us anymore she decided dejectedly Were as badly off now as Ozma and the others Why oh why did we ever come into this terrible forest She could feel Pigasus sniffing with sympathy and suddenly realizing that she was not behaving very well she straightened up After all she was still a Princess even though she was black Princesses did not cry even when they were captured and enchanted Ozma was probably in a worse fix than this and if Ozma was being brave she would be brave too So with a great effort Dorothy stifled her sobs and began to look around her To her surprise and astonishment she discovered that the Black Forest was not dark and gloomy as it had seemed before but really quite beautiful There were many shades and degrees of blackness in the trees and flowers that thickly carpeted the ground Black birds twittered musically in the branches overhead and every now and then a deer peered timidly out at her from the woodsy depths between the tree trunks The Guard glancing over his shoulder and catching her interested expression ventured a smile Why he is not bad looking at all thought Dorothy with a pleased start And maybe this witch may be a good witch C4 her name sounds rather pretty Quite comforted by these reflections Dorothy whispered a few rhymed remarks in the pigs ear Pigasus it must be confessed was as interested in what he saw as Dorothy and when a sudden break between the trees revealed a great black circular wall with a hundred black flags floating from its many turrets he gave an involuntary grunt of admiration You are about to enter the Royal Circle of Gloma Witch of the Black Forest announced the Guard raising his hand solemnly I trust you will conduct yourselves in a fitting manner Dont worry about OUR manners shrilled Pigasus tossing his head airily We are accustomed to Royalty and move in exclusive circles at home And talk in circles too muttered the Guard impatiently Well well do the best you can and bow three times as you approach the throne Throne queried Dorothy slipping off the pigs back so she would not have to talk in rhyme for what she had to say to the black witch was very serious indeed Is Gloma a Queen Certainly our witch is a Queen a bewitching Queen retorted the Guard taking Dorothy firmly by the hand and tightening his hold on Pigasus Now then smile and look pleasant and perhaps shell allow you to be her slave She wouldnt dare make me a slave cried Dorothy trying her best to pull away from her captor Just let her try it blustered Pigasus scuffling unwillingly along on the other side But paying no attention to their struggles the Guard lifted his foot and kicked three times on a black ebony door in the wall and a tall Watchman dressed in a black leather suit admitted them to the Royal Circle It was all so different from what Dorothy had been expecting she almost forgot her anger Enclosed by the black marble wall was a strange and enchanting garden Now Dorothy had never seen a black garden or dreamed one could be so beautiful Here sable willows mirrored their feathery branches in long shining pools here black plum and cherry trees flaunted their fragile black blossoms and jetblack fountains sent their smoking waters high into the quiet air Vast satiny expanses of lawn were dotted with a hundred beds of dusky roses tulips velvety pansies and daffodils Built all round the circular wall was a low but sumptuous black castle and seated on an ebony throne in the center of her stately black garden was the Black Queen herself looking Dorothy was thankful to discover much more like a Queen than a witch Glomas face was sweet and serious her hair fine and glossy as a ravens wing She was dressed in a trailing robe black chiffon that billowed in lacy clouds round her feet A sparkling crown of jet and long jet earrings were her only ornaments On each side of the Black Queen crouched a sleek black leopard and behind the ebony throne stood ten tall foresters with gleaming axes Like headsmen in a medieval history book thought Dorothy as she and Pigasus were dragged rapidly forward Gloma gazing dreamily into a black crystal set on a marble stand before the throne seemed entirely unaware of their presence till the harsh voice of the Black Guard announced them Hail Black and Imperial Majesty called the Guard deferentially approaching the throne Two prisoners a pig and a Princess whom I found wandering unlawfully in our forest and whom I took the liberty of blacking Dorothy jerking away from the Guard was about to explain how she and Pigasus had lost their way when Gloma jumped to her feet with a sharp agonized scream Blotz General Blotz what have you done panted the Black Queen beating her hands wildl
