 expects us we must not keep her waiting LineArt Drawing 239 So they all clambered out of the sofas and followed the Captain toward the palaceeven the SawHorse taking his place in the queer procession Upon her throne of finely wrought gold sat Glinda and she could scarcely repress a smile as her peculiar visitors entered and bowed before her Both the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman she knew and liked but the awkward Pumpkinhead and Highly Magnified WoggleBug were creatures she had never seen before and they seemed even more curious than the others As for the SawHorse he looked to be nothing more than an animated chunk of wood and he bowed so stiffly that his head bumped against the floor causing a ripple of laughter among the soldiers in which Glinda frankly joined I beg to announce to your glorious highness began the Scarecrow in a solemn voice that my Emerald City has been overrun by a crowd of impudent girls with knittingneedles who have enslaved all the men robbed the streets and public buildings of all their emerald jewels and usurped my throne I know it said Glinda They also threatened to destroy me as well as all the good friends and allies you see before you continued the Scarecrow and had we not managed 240 to escape their clutches our days would long since have ended I know it repeated Glinda Therefore I have come to beg your assistance resumed the Scarecrow for I believe you are always glad to succor the unfortunate and oppressed That is true replied the Sorceress slowly But the Emerald City is now ruled by General Jinjur who has caused herself to be proclaimed Queen What right have I to oppose her Why she stole the throne from me said the Scarecrow And how came you to possess the throne asked Glinda I got it from the Wizard of Oz and by the choice of the people returned the Scarecrow uneasy at such questioning And where did the Wizard get it she continued gravely I am told he took it from Pastoria the former King said the Scarecrow becoming confused under the intent look of the Sorceress Then declared Glinda the throne of the Emerald City belongs neither to you nor to Jinjur but to this Pastoria from whom the Wizard usurped it That is true acknowledged the Scarecrow 241 humbly but Pastoria is now dead and gone and some one must rule in his place Pastoria had a daughter who is the rightful heir to the throne of the Emerald City Did you know that questioned the Sorceress No replied the Scarecrow But if the girl still lives I will not stand in her way It will satisfy me as well to have Jinjur turned out as an impostor as to regain the throne myself In fact it isnt much fun to be King especially if one has good brains I have known for some time that I am fitted to occupy a far more exalted position But where is the girl who owns the throne and what is her name Her name is Ozma answered Glinda But where she is I have tried in vain to discover For the Wizard of Oz when he stole the throne from Ozmas father hid the girl in some secret place and by means of a magical trick with which I am not familiar he also managed to prevent her being discoveredeven by so experienced a Sorceress as myself That is strange interrupted the WoggleBug pompously I have been informed that the Wonderful Wizard of Oz was nothing more than a humbug 242 Nonsense exclaimed the Scarecrow much provoked by this speech Didnt he give me a wonderful set of brains Theres no humbug about my heart announced the Tin Woodman glaring indignantly at the WoggleBug Perhaps I was misinformed stammered the Insect shrinking back I never knew the Wizard personally Well we did retorted the Scarecrow and he was a very great Wizard I assure you It is true he was guilty of some slight impostures but unless he was a great Wizard howlet me askcould he have hidden this girl Ozma so securely that no one can find her II give it up replied the WoggleBug meekly That is the most sensible speech youve made said the Tin Woodman I must really make another effort to discover where this girl is hidden resumed the Sorceress thoughtfully I have in my library a book in which is inscribed every action of the Wizard while he was in our land of Ozor at least every action that could be observed by my spies This book I will read carefully tonight and try to single out the acts that may guide us in discovering the lost Ozma In 243 the meantime pray amuse yourselves in my palace and command my servants as if they were your own I will grant you another audience tomorrow With this gracious speech Glinda dismissed the adventurers and they wandered away through the beautiful gardens where they passed several hours enjoying all the delightful things with which the Queen of the Southland had surrounded her royal palace On the following morning they again appeared before Glinda who said to them I have searched carefully through the records of the Wizards actions and among them I can find but three that appear to have been suspicious He ate beans with a knife made three secret visits
