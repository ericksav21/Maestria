thing happened The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon The north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather It was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily After the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle Toto did not like it He ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen Once Toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall She crept to the hole caught Toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen Hour after hour passed away and slowly Dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and Toto followed and lay down beside her In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep 2 The Council with the Munchkins She was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt As it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding the little room She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw The cyclone had set the house down very gentlyfor a cyclonein the midst of a country of marvelous beauty There were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes A little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small In fact they seemed about as tall as Dorothy who was a wellgrown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older Three were men and one a woman and all were oddly dressed They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved The hats of the men were blue the little womans hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds The men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore wellpolished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops The men Dorothy thought were about as old as Uncle Henry for two of them had beards But the little woman was doubtless much older Her face was covered with wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice You are welcome most noble Sorceress to the land of the Munchkins We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East and for setting our people free from bondage Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East Dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her li
