 all And lifting his head in spite of Skamperoos great weight he spoke proudly and confidently Whoever you are we welcome you to Oz and if you can explain this unearthly and unexpected darkness we will gladly follow you and do as you say Good chuckled Bitty Bit tugging manfully at his bridle This way please There was still so much screaming and confusion in the Throne Room no one had overheard the conversation between the newcomers and the Emperors horse and guided by the invisible hand Chalk crossed the room without bumping into anything or anybody A moment later they were in the dark quiet laboratory that had once belonged to the Wizard of Oz CHAPTER 18 THE EMPERORS HORSE MAKES A BARGAIN Bitty Bits shooting tower had made a record trip to the Emerald City and guided by the little Seer of Some Summit had come to a deft and dexterous stop right outside the windows of the great Throne Room After a short anxious look inside and before anyone was aware of their arrival Dorothy removed the lid from the box of the powder of darkness and threw a generous pinch into the air plunging the Emerald City into an instant and thunderous dark Under cover of this magic darkness Dorothy Pigasus and Bitty Bit boldly entered the palace and singled out the white horse and his terrified Master They had fully expected some resistance C4 Dorothy had brought a long piece of rope and Pigasus carried a stout club under his wing C4 but they were delighted to find the Emperor too frightened and his white horse too clever to resist an invisible foe Being able to see in the dark themselves they had Chalk and Skamperoo at a decided advantage Dorothys plans now that they had actually returned to the Emerald City were rather vague but Bitty Bit knew just what he hoped and intended to do His seerish powers had enabled him to discover that all the changes in Oz had been brought about by the magic emeralds which in some way had fallen into Skamperoos hands and these emeralds Bitty Bit meant to have at the earliest possible moment So first he ordered all the windows and doors to the laboratory closed then annoyed by the screams and crashes still issuing from every room in the castle he advised Dorothy to put the lid back on the powder of darkness But supposing someone disturbs us before we finish objected Pigasus looking doubtfully at the tremendous warhorse who stood with feet braced and ears back ready to listen or defy them Somehow Chalk had managed to toss Skamperoo back into the saddle and with both hands fixed grimly in the horses mane the Emperor was blinking his eyes in a vain attempt to see them or catch a glimpse of Matiah for he was convinced that the merchant was at the bottom of the whole procedure If we agree to lift this pall of darkness will you agree to grant us an uninterrupted hour of your time asked Bitty Bit turning toward the Emperor but really addressing the horse whom he considered the better man of the two I think we can without undue danger promise that answered Chalk guardedly while Skamperoo hemmed and hawed with indecision Of course you must promise to use no more magic against us Well the same goes for you too remember put in Pigasus quickly An hours time and conversation and no trickery But who C4 who are you muttered Skamperoo finding his voice at last I seem to hear three different voices Youll soon see answered Dorothy clapping the lid on her powder of darkness With a suddenness that made them all gasp the laboratory was again flooded with the bright noon sunshine and in a determined row before him Skamperoo saw a pretty little girl in green a fat pink pig with white wings and a small wrinkled old gentleman in brown Wwhy whinnied Chalk drawing in a deep breath of relief at first I thought you were enemies but now I see that you are merely visitors and friends That depends observed Bitty Bit seating himself on a tall stool that brought him on a level with Chalks nose I am the Seer of Some Summit but these others are Princess Dorothy and Pigasus the Winged Pig They really belong in this palace and are close friends of the rightful ruler of this country Ozma of Oz I am the rightful ruler of Oz shouted Skamperoo growing red in the face and thrusting out his three chins belligerently Oh dont bother putting on a show for me exclaimed Bitty Bit waving his arms impatiently Remember I am a Seer I know all I see all and what is more I TELL ALL You my pretty fellow are really the King of Skampavia a small nocount country on the other side of the Deadly Desert In some way the longlost necklaces of Lorna the Wood Nymph have come into your possession With these necklaces you have enchanted the people of Oz into believing you are their ruler You have wickedly banished Ozma and her allies and counselors and unlawfully made yourself Emperor of Oz That seems to cover everything drawled Chalk as Skamperoo turned from red to purple Not everything went on Bitty Bit shaking his finger sternly under Chalks nose Kingdoms are not won
