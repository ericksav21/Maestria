 very unhappy answered the china Princess You see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawingroom tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country I would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed Dorothy So Ill just say goodbye Goodbye replied the Princess They walked carefully through the china country The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall It was not so high as the first however and by standing upon the Lions back they all managed to scramble to the top Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces That was too bad said Dorothy but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cows leg and a church They are all so brittle They are indeed said the Scarecrow and I am thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow 21 The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight However by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground But here the country seemed wilder than ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen This forest is perfectly delightful declared the Lion looking around him with joy Never have I seen a more beautiful place It seems gloomy said the Scarecrow Not a bit of it answered the Lion I should like to live here all my life See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said Dorothy I suppose there are returned the Lion but I do not see any of them about They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual When morning came they started again Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild animals Toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the welltrodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a moment Dorothy was afraid But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed saying Welcome O King of Beasts You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more What is your trouble asked the Lion quietly We are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest It is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk It has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us The Lion thought for a moment Are there any other lions in this forest he asked No there were some but the monster has eaten them all And besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you If I put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest inquired the Lion We will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar We will Where is this great spider of yours now asked the Lion Yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot Take good care of these friends of mine said the Lion and I will go at once to fight the monster He bade his comrades goodbye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe t
