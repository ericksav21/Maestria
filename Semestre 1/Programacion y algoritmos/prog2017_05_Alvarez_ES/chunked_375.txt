 take his fallen comrades place but before he could snatch the wire Randy brought him to earth with one of his sharply pointed darts The next who ventured he shot down too and as the rest of the band came swarming down to see what was happening Randy sent arrow after arrow winging into their midst till the flat smooth rock was dotted with sleepy heads for each one hit promptly fell asleep Though his arm ached and his heart thumped uncomfortably Randy did not even pause for breath till he had sent the last arrow into the air and then quite suddenly he realized he had won this strange and ridiculous battle More than half of the earmen as he could not help calling them to himself lay snoring on the ground the rest with terrified shrieks and whistles were flapping off as fast as their ears could carry then Now entirely free of the wire but still trembling and gasping Kabumpo stared angrily after them What I cannot understand puffed Randy sliding down to the ground to examine a group of the enemy is what put them to sleep I thought your darts might hurt or head them off or puncture them like balloons but instead C4 here they are asleep and HOW asleep Shall I pull out the arrows I might need them later Theyre not MY arrows Kabumpo said wrinkling his forehead in a puzzled frown I didnt have any arrows but Ha Ha Kerumph The Elegant Elephant began to shake all over They must be Gaper Arrows C4 the Wakes must have stuck them in my pocket when they fetched my robe and headpiece Pretty cute of the little rascals at that Why these must be the same arrows the Winks shot at me Randy but my hide was too tough for them and they didnt work Well they certainly made short work of the Headmen said Randy turning one over gently with his foot Goodness I thought youd be choked and done for old fellow Who ME Nonsense My neck would have broken their teeth in another minute or two Well then shall I pull out the arrows asked Randy who had his own opinion about Kabumpos narrow escape We could use them again some time No NO Leave them in So long as those arrows stick fast the little villains will sleep fast and thats the only way I can stand em But suppose the others fly back Randy still hesitated Pooh Dont you worry about that Kabumpo raised his trunk scornfully Theyre frightened out of their wits and probably half way to the Sapphire City by this time And when they do come back we wont be here Wont we Dubiously Randy began to pace across the bare and arid plateau I certainly dont think much of Headland do you I wouldnt have it for a gift even if they threw in a tusk brush and diamond earrings besides snorted Kabumpo Why its nothing but a humpy bumpy acre of rock without a tree a house a bird or even a blade of grass Id give the whole country for a mouthful of hay or a bucketful of water We might find a spring among the rocks proposed Randy hurrying along hopefully More likely a fall predicted Kabumpo trudging gloomily behind him But just then Randy who had vanished behind a sizeable boulder gave an excited whoop Hi yi Kabumpo Were here Were here right on the edge of it he shouted vociferously LOOK The Elegant Elephant pushing round the rock did look then mopping his forehead with the tip of his robe sank heavily to his haunches and for a moment neither said a word For truly enough the jagged point of Headland projected over the desert as a high cliff hangs over the sea Below the seething sand smoked churned and tumbled sending up sulphurous waves of heat that made both travelers cough and splutter So all we have to do is cross gasped Randy dashing the tears brought by the smoke out of his eyes And a simple thing that will be grunted the Elegant Elephant sarcastically seeing that one foot on the sand spells instant destruction If we could just flap our ears like the Headmen we could fly across But as we cant sighed Randy seating himself despondently on a boulder what are we to do Well that remains to be seen muttered Kabumpo who had not the faintest notion FF20Never cross a Deadly Desert on an empty stomach is my motto and Im going to stick to it Sticking to mottoes wont get us anywhere Randy said skimming a stone off the edge and watching with a little shudder as it was sucked down into the whirling sand Doesnt that desert make you thirsty Goopers if I had a dipperful of water Id gladly do without the breakfast Humph Looks as if you might have that wish Feeling hurriedly in the right pocket of his robe Kabumpo dragged out a waterproof as large as a tent Just spread this over me will you he puffed anxiously Storm coming Hear that thunder Storm coming Coming cried Randy springing up to help Kabumpo with the buckles Why its here He had to raise his voice to a scream to make himself heard above the gale that arising apparently from nowhere struck them furiously from behind He had just fastened the last strap of the waterproof to Kabumpos left ankle when the rain swept down in perfect torrents rain accompanied by hailstones as big as Easte
