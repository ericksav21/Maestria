see a prisoner before you is accused of the crime of first murdering and then eating our esteemed Rulers fat pigletor else first eating and then murdering it In either case a grave crime has been committed which deserves a grave punishment Do you mean my kitten must be put in a grave asked Dorothy Dont interrupt little girl said the WoggleBug When I get my thoughts arranged in good order I do not like to have anything upset them or throw them into confusion If your thoughts were any good they wouldnt become confused remarked the Scarecrow earnestly My thoughts are always Is this a trial of thoughts or of kittens demanded the WoggleBug Its a trial of one kitten replied the Scarecrow but your manner is a trial to us all Let the Public Accuser continue called Ozma from her throne and I pray you do not interrupt him The criminal who now sits before the court licking her paws resumed the WoggleBug has long desired to unlawfully eat the fat piglet which was no bigger than a mouse And finally she made a wicked plan to satisfy her depraved appetite for pork I can see her in my minds eye Whats that asked the Scarecrow I say I can see her in my minds eye The mind has no eye declared the Scarecrow Its blind Your Highness cried the WoggleBug appealing to Ozma have I a minds eye or havent I If you have it is invisible said the Princess Very true returned the WoggleBug bowing I say I see the criminal in my minds eye creeping stealthily into the room of our Ozma and secreting herself when no one was looking until the Princess had gone away and the door was closed Then the murderer was alone with her helpless victim the fat piglet and I see her pounce upon the innocent creature and eat it up Are you still seeing with your minds eye enquired the Scarecrow Of course how else could I see it And we know the thing is true because since the time of that interview there is no piglet to be found anywhere I suppose if the cat had been gone instead of the piglet your minds eye would see the piglet eating the cat suggested the Scarecrow Very likely acknowledged the WoggleBug And now Fellow Citizens and Creatures of the Jury I assert that so awful a crime deserves death and in the case of the ferocious criminal before youwho is now washing her facethe death penalty should be inflicted nine times There was great applause when the speaker sat down Then the Princess spoke in a stern voice Prisoner what have you to say for yourself Are you guilty or not guilty Why thats for you to find out replied Eureka If you can prove Im guilty Ill be willing to die nine times but a minds eye is no proof because the WoggleBug has no mind to see with Never mind dear said Dorothy Then the Tin Woodman arose and said Respected Jury and dearly beloved Ozma I pray you not to judge this feline prisoner unfeelingly I do not think the innocent kitten can be guilty and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder Eureka is the sweet pet of a lovely little girl whom we all admire and gentleness and innocence are her chief virtues Look at the kittens intelligent eyes here Eureka closed her eyes sleepily gaze at her smiling countenance here Eureka snarled and showed her teeth mark the tender pose of her soft padded little hands Here Eureka bared her sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage Would such a gentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature No a thousand times no Oh cut it short said Eureka youve talked long enough Im trying to defend you remonstrated the Tin Woodman Then say something sensible retorted the kitten Tell them it would be foolish for me to eat the piglet because I had sense enough to know it would raise a row if I did But dont try to make out Im too innocent to eat a fat piglet if I could do it and not be found out I imagine it would taste mighty good Perhaps it would to those who eat remarked the Tin Woodman I myself not being built to eat have no personal experience in such matters But I remember that our great poet once said To eat is sweet When hungers seat Demands a treat Of savory meat Take this into consideration friends of the Jury and you will readily decide that the kitten is wrongfully accused and should be set at liberty When the Tin Woodman sat down no one applauded him for his arguments had not been very convincing and few believed that he had proved Eurekas innocence As for the Jury the members whispered to each other for a few minutes and then they appointed the Hungry Tiger their spokesman The huge beast slowly arose and said Kittens have no consciences so they eat whatever pleases them The jury believes the white kitten known as Eureka is guilty of having eaten the piglet owned by Princess Ozma and recommends that she be put to death in punishment of the crime The judgment of the jury was received with great applause although Dorothy was sobbing miserably at the fate of her pet The Princess was just about to order Eurekas head chopped off with the Tin Woodmans axe when that brilliant personage once
