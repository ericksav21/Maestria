te young I grieve to say and all of my brothers and sisters that you see here are practically my own age If I remember rightly we were sixtysix years old the day before yesterday But that isnt young cried Dorothy in amazement No drawled the dragonette it seems to me very babyish How old is your mother asked the girl Mothers about two thousand years old but she carelessly lost track of her age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds Shes a little fussy you know and afraid of growing old being a widow and still in her prime I should think she would be agreed Dorothy Then after a moments thought she asked Are we friends or enemies I mean will you be good to us or do you intend to eat us As for that we dragonettes would love to eat you my child but unfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the back of our individual caves so that we can not crawl out to get you If you choose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink but unless you do you will remain quite safe There was a regretful accent in the creatures voice and at the words all the other dragonettes sighed dismally Dorothy felt relieved Presently she asked Why did your mother tie your tails Oh she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips and if we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight with each other and get into a lot of mischief Mother usually knows what she is about but she made a mistake this time for you are sure to escape us unless you come too near and you probably wont do that No indeed said the little girl We dont wish to be eaten by such awful beasts Permit me to say returned the dragonette that you are rather impolite to call us names knowing that we cannot resent your insults We consider ourselves very beautiful in appearance for mother has told us so and she knows And we are of an excellent family and have a pedigree that I challenge any humans to equal as it extends back about twenty thousand years to the time of the famous Green Dragon of Atlantis who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created Can you match that pedigree little girl Well said Dorothy I was born on a farm in Kansas and I guess thats being just as spectable and haughty as living in a cave with your tail tied to a rock If it isnt Ill have to stand it thats all Tastes differ murmured the dragonette slowly drooping its scaley eyelids over its yellow eyes until they looked like halfmoons Being reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out of their rockpockets the children and the Wizard now took time to examine them more closely The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrels and covered with hard greenish scales that glittered brightly under the light of the lanterns Their front legs which grew just back of their heads were also strong and big but their bodies were smaller around than their heads and dwindled away in a long line until their tails were slim as a shoestring Dorothy thought if it had taken them sixtysix years to grow to this size that it would be fully a hundred years more before they could hope to call themselves dragons and that seemed like a good while to wait to grow up It occurs to me said the Wizard that we ought to get out of this place before the mother dragon comes back Dont hurry called one of the dragonettes mother will be glad to meet you Im sure You may be right replied the Wizard but were a little particular about associating with strangers Will you kindly tell us which way your mother went to get on top the earth That is not a fair question to ask us declared another dragonette For if we told you truly you might escape us altogether and if we told you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished Then decided Dorothy we must find our way out the best we can They circled all around the cavern keeping a good distance away from the blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes and presently discovered that there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the place where they had entered They selected one of these at a venture and hurried along it as fast as they could go for they had no idea when the mother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make her acquaintance 14 Ozma Uses the Magic Belt For a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentle incline and the wanderers made such good progress that they grew hopeful and eager thinking they might see sunshine at any minute But at length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off the passage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther This rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot When first they came to it there was a solid wall before them but presently it revolved until there was exposed a wide smooth path across it to the other side This appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to take advantage of it at first and allowed the rocky wall to swing a
