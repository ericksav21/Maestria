e over the Land But who wrote it Mandys rocker stopped with a surprised squeak Nobody knows answered Nox soberly but it has come true dozens and dozens of times Each time a new King is crowned in Keretaria a new Ox appears mysteriously at the Royal coronation If anything happens to the Royal Ox the King also is destroyed MyC4y The Goat Girl now rocked very fast indeed So thats the reason they take such good care of you old Toggins But tell me where do all of you Royal Oxen come from in the first place And how is it you can speak None of the beasts on Mount Mern can say a word Oh thatFF20C4 the Royal Ox lifted his head lazily Keretaria is in the wonderful Land of Oz my dear Handy and all Oz creatures can talk even the mice and squirrels But what part of Oz we white oxen really come from I myself cannot say I seem to remember a great blue forest and many happy days there Then one evening a silver cloth was thrown over my head and I fell into a deep and immediate slumber When I awakened I was here in Keretaria and on that same day little King Kerry was crowned King of the Realm From the attendants and courtiers I learned of the strange prophecy but the young boy King was so devoted to me C4 and I to him C4 I did not miss the forest or my former freedom To be near me Kerry had this apartment built in the stable and spent more than half of his time in my company My life being easy and pleasant I gave little thought to the past or to the future but spent all my energies enjoying the present Once in a while just for the looks of the thing I appeared in Royal Processions and each day at sundown I was yoked for an hour to the golden plow and required to stand for an hour in the royal garden But I never did any real work or plowing till you my reckless Handy came along today But what about the little King begged the Goat Girl as Nox lapsed into a thoughtful silence and seemed to have forgotten all about her He disappeared just as I told you The Royal Ox rolled his big eyes mournfully upward On this day as on many others I carried him on my back to the edge of the wood There mounting his favorite steed he rode away with the Royal Huntsmen for an hours sport As I was returning to the castle someone struck me a terrific blow that felled me to the earth where I lay for several hours in complete unconsciousness Whoever struck me down evidently thought I was finished for when I finally did regain my senses I was buried beneath a heap of loose earth and leaves Still dazed and hardly knowing what I was about I struggled out and staggered back to the courtyard One of my horns had been bent during the encounter and my expression was so wild and distracted that no one recognized me as BOZ the Royal Ox of little King Kerry The whole castle was in an uproar for a new King had taken possession of the throne and thinking of course I was the next and new Royal Ox this rascally imposter named me NOX The Keretarians without daring to inquire what had become of their former ruler crowned me with daisies and laurel and hurried to do the bidding of their new ruler WHY C4 the big cowards said Handy Mandy clenching all of her fists And do you mean to tell me nothing has been heard of the little King since then Nothing The Royal Ox moved his head drearily from side to side The people think the Royal Prophecy has been fulfilled again and what can they DO A farmers boy brought word that Boz the Royal Ox had been struck down and spirited away so naturally they felt sure that Kerry also had been destroyed or taken prisoner Then no one suspects you are really Boz and not NOX questioned the Goat Girl now on the very edge of her chair Oh myC4y but dont you see if you are still the same Ox who came to Keretaria with King Kerry and you are still all right he must be all right too That is if the prophecy means anything ShC4hh warned Nox looking about nervously Someone might hear you That is what keeps me here he went on seriously I felt if I stayed quietly in my place Kerry would some day return claim his own throne and drive this miserable tyrant out of the country Stay quietly here when the little fellow may be needing you cried Handy aghast Oh why dont you go look for him you great big OX you Come on what are we waiting for Why Ill drag that old rascal off the throne with my own hands promised the Goat Girl indignantly waving her arms Wait Stop Nox sprang up with surprising lightness for one usually so ponderous and slow Do you realize that I am treasured and watched more closely than the crown jewels At this very moment twenty guardsmen stalk round and round the stable I have as much chance of leaving Keretaria as a goldfish has of flying through a forest As if to prove his words a tall soldier in a blue shako thrust his head suddenly through the window from the outside Is everything in order and as you wish your Highness puffed the Guard looking suspiciously at the Goat Girls revolving arms Everything is lovely murmured the Ox in a sleepy voice
