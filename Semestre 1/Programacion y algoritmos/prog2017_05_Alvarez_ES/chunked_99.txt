eakfast she said to Billina who sat beside her curiously watching But when one is hungry one can eat even supper in the morning and not complain I hope your lunchbox was perfectly ripe observed the yellow hen in a anxious tone So much sickness is caused by eating green things Oh Im sure it was ripe declared Dorothy all that is cept the pickle and a pickle just HAS to be green Billina But everything tasted perfectly splendid and Id rather have it than a church picnic And now I think Ill pick a dinnerpail to have when I get hungry again and then well start out and splore the country and see where we are Havent you any idea what country this is inquired Billina None at all But listen Im quite sure its a fairy country or such things as lunchboxes and dinnerpails wouldnt be growing upon trees Besides Billina being a hen you wouldnt be able to talk in any civlized country like Kansas where no fairies live at all Perhaps were in the Land of Oz said the hen thoughtfully No that cant be answered the little girl because Ive been to the Land of Oz and its all surrounded by a horrid desert that no one can cross Then how did you get away from there again asked Billina I had a pair of silver shoes that carried me through the air but I lost them said Dorothy Ah indeed remarked the yellow hen in a tone of unbelief Anyhow resumed the girl there is no seashore near the Land of Oz so this must surely be some other fairy country While she was speaking she selected a bright and pretty dinnerpail that seemed to have a stout handle and picked it from its branch Then accompanied by the yellow hen she walked out of the shadow of the trees toward the seashore They were part way across the sands when Billina suddenly cried in a voice of terror Whats that Dorothy turned quickly around and saw coming out of a path that led from between the trees the most peculiar person her eyes had ever beheld It had the form of a man except that it walked or rather rolled upon all fours and its legs were the same length as its arms giving them the appearance of the four legs of a beast Yet it was no beast that Dorothy had discovered for the person was clothed most gorgeously in embroidered garments of many colors and wore a straw hat perched jauntily upon the side of its head But it differed from human beings in this respect that instead of hands and feet there grew at the end of its arms and legs round wheels and by means of these wheels it rolled very swiftly over the level ground Afterward Dorothy found that these odd wheels were of the same hard substance that our fingernails and toenails are composed of and she also learned that creatures of this strange race were born in this queer fashion But when our little girl first caught sight of the first individual of a race that was destined to cause her a lot of trouble she had an idea that the brilliantlyclothed personage was on rollerskates which were attached to his hands as well as to his feet Run screamed the yellow hen fluttering away in great fright Its a Wheeler A Wheeler exclaimed Dorothy What can that be Dont you remember the warning in the sand Beware the Wheelers Run I tell yourun So Dorothy ran and the Wheeler gave a sharp wild cry and came after her in full chase Looking over her shoulder as she ran the girl now saw a great procession of Wheelers emerging from the forestdozens and dozens of themall clad in splendid tightfitting garments and all rolling swiftly toward her and uttering their wild strange cries Theyre sure to catch us panted the girl who was still carrying the heavy dinnerpail she had picked I cant run much farther Billina Climb up this hillquick said the hen and Dorothy found she was very near to the heap of loose and jagged rocks they had passed on their way to the forest The yellow hen was even now fluttering among the rocks and Dorothy followed as best she could half climbing and half tumbling up the rough and rugged steep She was none too soon for the foremost Wheeler reached the hill a moment after her but while the girl scrambled up the rocks the creature stopped short with howls of rage and disappointment Dorothy now heard the yellow hen laughing in her cackling henny way Dont hurry my dear cried Billina They cant follow us among these rocks so were safe enough now Dorothy stopped at once and sat down upon a broad boulder for she was all out of breath The rest of the Wheelers had now reached the foot of the hill but it was evident that their wheels would not roll upon the rough and jagged rocks and therefore they were helpless to follow Dorothy and the hen to where they had taken refuge But they circled all around the little hill so the child and Billina were fast prisoners and could not come down without being captured Then the creatures shook their front wheels at Dorothy in a threatening manner and it seemed they were able to speak as well as to make their dreadful outcries for several of them shouted Well get you in time never fear And when we do get you well te
