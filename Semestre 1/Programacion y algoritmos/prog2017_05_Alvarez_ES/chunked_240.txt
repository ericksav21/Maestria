 as to what would happen once the King mounted on his back Yes together insisted Skamperoo Try to think he begged earnestly You say you know nothing then how did you know you came from Oz and your name and all that Thats right how did I Putting one ear forward and one ear backward Chalk swallowed his hay with a quick gulp There must be a lot of stuff in my head that I practically know nothing about he reasoned thoughtfully Suppose you tell me exactly what happened and then Ill tell you what I think of it So hunching forward Skamperoo recounted the whole story of the merchant and the necklaces how he and Matiah had retired to his private garden how there with the merchant wearing the emeralds his first wish had been granted And a splendid wish it was too sighed Skamperoo looking fondly up at his white horse Never forget that you were my first wish fellow Im hardly likely to forget myself snickered Chalk loftily but attend closely old Crown and Scepter when I dropped down into that garden yon whiskered merchant was running for the gate as if his life depended on it He only stopped because he was afraid to pass me and from the way he fell into those cactus bushes Ill wager he was as astonished as you were that the emeralds had granted your wish Chalk wrinkled his forehead shrewdly I dont believe he knows any more about the necklaces than we do If he did he would never have sent you one in the first place and he would have granted all of his own wishes and been in some splendid other place Matiahs a fraud finished the Kings horse vehemently And he means to steal back the emeralds Of course Of course Oh Oh Why didnt I think of that myself What shall we do now wailed Skamperoo jumping up so quickly he overturned the bucket for Chalks frankly spoken opinion confirmed his own suspicions of the merchant Sit down advised the white horse not unkindly I may not be a magician but I have a little sense and horse sense is what your Majesty needs more than anything else As Skamperoo righted the bucket and meekly sat down again Chalk closed his eyes standing silent and motionless for so long the King though he had fallen into a trance But just as he began to fidget nervously about on the uncomfortable edge of the bucket the white horse opened his eyes and flashing a triumphant smile at Skamperoo began calling in a loud lordly voice Boy BOY BOY While the King regarded him with mingled misgivings and admiration Chalk snapped out directions to the clumsy little groom who came running in answer to his summons When his mane and tail had been thoroughly brushed and he was decked out once more in the splendid saddle and trappings he had worn on his first appearance in Skampavia he dismissed the groom with a haughty toss of his head Come he breathed mysteriously Climb up Skamperoo and well Skamperoodle before that rascally merchant even misses us Have you decided upon the place we are to go he questioned curiously as the King made seven frantic efforts to put his foot in the golden stirrup Heh Heh Heh The other foot Master How do you ever expect to mount that way Stand on the bucket Kingaling catch hold of the saddle and pull Its easy as oats once you get the hang of it Is it Lying mournfully on his back where he had fallen after his last effort Skamperoo gazed mournfully upward and Chalk himself began to champ snort and switch his tail with irritation You wished me on yourself and now it looks as if you would have to wish yourself on me he muttered savagely Here give me those necklaces C4 hang them over my ear and lets have done with this shameful exhibition You mean if I wish myself upon your back I will really be there panted Skamperoo bouncing up like a rubber ball You mean you have discovered the secret of the emeralds Certainly The white horse regarded him scornfully through halfclosed eyes and the King all too willing to be convinced unclasped his three necklaces and standing on tiptoe hung them over Chalks right ear I C4 I wish to be upon this creatures back puffed Skamperoo his cheeks swelling out with suspense and importance One two three four five sixFF20C4 and scarcely had he begun to count before he found himself firmly seated in the saddle Now now not another word commanded Chalk sternly Before you dare to speak take those emeralds off my ear With shaking hands the King did as he was told his heart pounding so violently it almost kicked a hole in his shirt Thats right directed the white horse more mildly Now suppose you tell me where you intend to wish us and what we do after that Wishes are pretty quick you know and it is best to be prepared But C4 but I cannot understand how you make them work spluttered Skamperoo Its wonderful its marvelous Do you understand what this means Perfectly Chalk rolled his eyes triumphantly round at his greedy little Master My head seems to be full of magic which is not strange seeing that I was magically brought into existence and the trick of the necklaces once I got to thinking about
