und like a teetotum So there really IS such a place I have always said so Ato but no one would believe me Lies to the east of here doesnt it sonny and is twice as large as any known land bordering on the Nonestic Somewhat impressed to find that Samuel Salt knew something of his homeland the little boy nodded And do you suppose we could snare one of those creeping birds and flying reptiles if we managed to reach Ozamaland Grasping the bars of the cage Samuel peered anxiously into the young Kings face Do you suppose you could ever reach Ozamaland sighed Tazander returning Samuels eager look with gloomy aloofness Do you know that a ship has never touched our shores Then the Crescent Moon shall be the first cried Samuel Salt snapping his fingers joyfully Why this will be tremendous and the most momentous discovery in a thousand years But how do you happen to be so far from Ozamaland yourself asked Samuel Salt immediately afterward Did you come by air or sea That I cannot tell Tazander seated himself soberly on a log before he continued One night I was sleeping soundly in my tower in the White City next thing I remember I was here in this jungle The Leopard Men wild and savage as they were fed me when they remembered on raw fish and chunks of hard bitter bread they made from the roots of the Brima Tree But I could not understand their talk nor they mine and till Kobo found me a month after my imprisonment I had no one to talk to at all But she has come every day to keep me company and try to set me free and since the Leopard Men were drowned she has fed me too See through this little door Tazander opened a small door in the bars and stuck both hands through But how did you learn the language asked Ato turning round to gaze up into Nikobos huge face I dont know said Nikobo with an excited gulp I just started to say Hello and instead of saying it in hippopotamy there I was talking a strange language which I could understand as well as my own And in this language Tandy answered me much to my delight and pleasure Strange very strange Ato shook his head in a puzzled manner Well all I say is it was lucky for this small fellow that you happened along and once we have him aboard hell soon forget all these hardships and unpleasant experiences Ill never forget Kobo said the young King backing stiffly away from the outstretched arms of Ato And Koboll never forget YOU sniffed the hippopotamus The talk of the river people seems dull and stupid since Ive talked to Tandy None of the herd really need me and I dont know what Im going to do whoo Hoo HOO WHOOO Rocking from side to side Nikobo began to sob as if her heart would break so violently in fact that Samuel Salt covered both ears and Ato alarmed at the enormous grief of the gigantic beast tried to put his arms around her Here here begged the ships cook thumping her hard upon the back Opening the bag of biscuits Roger had brought from the ship Ato handed two to Tandy and began shoving the rest as fast as he could down the vast throat of the griefstricken hippopotamus After each biscuit Nikobo choked and sobbed to herself but on the whole they seemed to comfort her and when the Read Bird finally returned with the ax she watched almost cheerfully as Samuel Salt with wellaimed blows demolished Tandys jungle cage As the last side crashed down and without giving Tandy time to argue any further Samuel Salt seized the boy firmly in both arms and set him down on the back of the hippopotamus Then giving Ato a hand up behind him the Captain of the Crescent Moon sternly led the way to the edge of the island Roger waving an Oz flag flew ahead screaming defiantly to the monkeys and parrots that infested the island WAY WAY Way for the Royal Discoverer of Oz Way for the King of the Octagon Isle Way for Nikobo Little Daughter of the Biggenlittle River People Way for Tazander Tazoo King and son of a Kings son WAYayayyy CHAPTER 7 STRANGE SPECIMENS FOR SAMUEL SALT With no one to challenge their going but the birds and monkeys the little band made its way back to the sandy beach Tandy perhaps because he had been so long pent up in the silent jungle and because he was by nature a naturally sober and solemn little boy said nothing Not even the Crescent Moon riding so proudly at her anchor seemed to arouse any interest or enthusiasm in this strange young Ozamalander Well here we are exclaimed Ato heartily thankful to be in sight of the ship again And I hope youll not mind ferrying us out to the boat Nikobo Those crocodiles still look hungry and Ive no notion of being crocked for the rest of my life Any time you say grunted the hippopotamus squeaking a listless greeting to a company of her own relatives who were rolling lazily about in the muddy river water Avast and belay and whats the hurry Leaning his ax against a tree Samuel moistened a finger and held it up The winds against us mate so well have to wait for the tide Not only that but Roger and I must survey the island and dig up some more int
