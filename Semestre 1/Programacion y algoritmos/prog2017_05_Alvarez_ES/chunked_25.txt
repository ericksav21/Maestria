d lost She watched Dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothys room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing Indeed the old Witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way But the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length She was not much hurt but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off and before she could reach it the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and Dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so The little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the Witch Give me back my shoe I will not retorted the Witch for it is now my shoe and not yours You are a wicked creature cried Dorothy You have no right to take my shoe from me I shall keep it just the same said the Witch laughing at her and someday I shall get the other one from you too This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch wetting her from head to foot Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as Dorothy looked at her in wonder the Witch began to shrink and fall away See what you have done she screamed In a minute I shall melt away Im very sorry indeed said Dorothy who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes Didnt you know water would be the end of me asked the Witch in a wailing despairing voice Of course not answered Dorothy How should I Well in a few minutes I shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself I have been wicked in my day but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds Look outhere I go With these words the Witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess She then swept it all out the door After picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again Then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land 13 The Rescue The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free They went in together to the castle where Dorothys first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch who had always treated them with great cruelty They kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing If our friends the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were only with us said the Lion I should be quite happy Dont you suppose we could rescue them asked the girl anxiously We can try answered the Lion So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy who had set them free from bondage So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay all battered and bent His axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the Yellow Castle again Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend and the Lion looking sober and sorry When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies Are any of your people tinsmiths Oh yes Some of us are very good tinsmiths they told her Then bring them to me she said And when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together whe
