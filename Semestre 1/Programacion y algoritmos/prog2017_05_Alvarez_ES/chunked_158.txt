At the foot of the stairs was a sign reading WARNING These steps lead to the Land of the Gargoyles DANGER KEEP OUT I wonder how Jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs said Dorothy gravely No trouble at all declared the horse with a contemptuous neigh Still I dont care to drag any passengers Youll all have to walk Suppose the stairs get steeper suggested Zeb doubtfully Then youll have to boost the buggywheels thats all answered Jim Well try it anyway said the Wizard Its the only way to get out of the Valley of Voe So they began to ascend the stairs Dorothy and the Wizard first Jim next drawing the buggy and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened to the harness The light was dim and soon they mounted into total darkness so that the Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way But this enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing where there was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light and air Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lying far below them the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance After resting a few moments they resumed their climb and still the stairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw the buggy easily after him The old horse panted a little and had to stop often to get his breath At such times they were all glad to wait for him for continually climbing up stairs is sure to make ones legs ache They wound about always going upward for some time The lights from the lanterns dimly showed the way but it was a gloomy journey and they were pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were coming to a second landing Here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it like the mouth of a cavern and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and commenced ascending again at the opposite edge The opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley of Voe and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene Below them was a vast space at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling billows through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up Just above them and almost on a level with their platform were banks of rolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color The blues and greys were very beautiful and Dorothy noticed that on the cloud banks sat or reclined fleecy shadowy forms of beautiful beings who must have been the Cloud Fairies Mortals who stand upon the earth and look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms but our friends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the dainty fairies very clearly Are they real asked Zeb in an awed voice Of course replied Dorothy softly They are the Cloud Fairies They seem like openwork remarked the boy gazing intently If I should squeeze one there wouldnt be anything left of it In the open space between the clouds and the black bubbling sea far beneath could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way swiftly through the air These birds were of enormous size and reminded Zeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights They had fierce eyes and sharp talons and beaks and the children hoped none of them would venture into the cavern Well I declare suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard What in the world is this They turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center of the cave who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their attention He was a very old man bent nearly double but the queerest thing about him was his white hair and beard These were so long that they reached to his feet and both the hair and the beard were carefully plaited into many braids and the end of each braid fastened with a bow of colored ribbon Where did you come from asked Dorothy wonderingly No place at all answered the man with the braids that is not recently Once I lived on top the earth but for many years I have had my factory in this spothalf way up Pyramid Mountain Are we only half way up enquired the boy in a discouraged tone I believe so my lad replied the braided man But as I have never been in either direction down or up since I arrived I cannot be positive whether it is exactly half way or not Have you a factory in this place asked the Wizard who had been examining the strange personage carefully To be sure said the other I am a great inventor you must know and I manufacture my products in this lonely spot What are your products enquired the Wizard Well I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting and a superior grade of Rustles for ladies silk gowns I thought so said the Wizard with a sigh May we examine some of these articles Yes indeed come into my shop please and the braided man turned and led the way into a smaller cave where he evidently lived Here on a broad shelf were several cardboard boxes of various sizes each tied with cotton cord This said the man taking up a box and handling it gently contains twelve dozen rustlesenough to last any lady a year Will
