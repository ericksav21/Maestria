d Tiktok marching side by side just behind him After these tramped the Army looking brave and handsome in their splendid uniforms The generals commanded the colonels and the colonels commanded the majors and the majors commanded the captains and the captains commanded the private who marched with an air of proud importance because it required so many officers to give him his orders And so the magnificent procession left the palace and started along the road just as day was breaking and by the time the sun came out they had made good progress toward the valley that led to the Nome Kings domain 10 The Giant with the Hammer The road led for a time through a pretty farm country and then past a picnic grove that was very inviting But the procession continued to steadily advance until Billina cried in an abrupt and commanding manner Waitwait Ozma stopped her chariot so suddenly that the Scarecrows Sawhorse nearly ran into it and the ranks of the army tumbled over one another before they could come to a halt Immediately the yellow hen struggled from Dorothys arms and flew into a clump of bushes by the roadside Whats the matter called the Tin Woodman anxiously Why Billina wants to lay her egg thats all said Dorothy Lay her egg repeated the Tin Woodman in astonishment Yes she lays one every morning about this time and its quite fresh said the girl But does your foolish old hen suppose that this entire cavalcade which is bound on an important adventure is going to stand still while she lays her egg enquired the Tin Woodman earnestly What else can we do asked the girl Its a habit of Billinas and she cant break herself of it Then she must hurry up said the Tin Woodman impatiently No no exclaimed the Scarecrow If she hurries she may lay scrambled eggs Thats nonsense said Dorothy But Billina wont be long Im sure So they stood and waited although all were restless and anxious to proceed And by and by the yellow hen came from the bushes saying Kutkut kut kadawkutt Kut kut kutkadawkut What is she doingsinging her lay asked the Scarecrow Forwardmarch shouted the Tin Woodman waving his axe and the procession started just as Dorothy had once more grabbed Billina in her arms Isnt anyone going to get my egg cried the hen in great excitement Ill get it said the Scarecrow and at his command the Sawhorse pranced into the bushes The straw man soon found the egg which he placed in his jacket pocket The cavalcade having moved rapidly on was even then far in advance but it did not take the Sawhorse long to catch up with it and presently the Scarecrow was riding in his accustomed place behind Ozmas chariot What shall I do with the egg he asked Dorothy I do not know the girl answered Perhaps the Hungry Tiger would like it It would not be enough to fill one of my back teeth remarked the Tiger A bushel of them hard boiled might take a little of the edge off my appetite but one egg isnt good for anything at all that I know of No it wouldnt even make a sponge cake said the Scarecrow thoughtfully The Tin Woodman might carry it with his axe and hatch it but after all I may as well keep it myself for a souvenir So he left it in his pocket They had now reached that part of the valley that lay between the two high mountains which Dorothy had seen from her tower window At the far end was the third great mountain which blocked the valley and was the northern edge of the Land of Ev It was underneath this mountain that the Nome Kings palace was said to be but it would be some time before they reached that place The path was becoming rocky and difficult for the wheels of the chariot to pass over and presently a deep gulf appeared at their feet which was too wide for them to leap So Ozma took a small square of green cloth from her pocket and threw it upon the ground At once it became the magic carpet and unrolled itself far enough for all the cavalcade to walk upon The chariot now advanced and the green carpet unrolled before it crossing the gulf on a level with its banks so that all passed over in safety Thats easy enough said the Scarecrow I wonder what will happen next He was not long in making the discovery for the sides of the mountain came closer together until finally there was but a narrow path between them along which Ozma and her party were forced to pass in single file They now heard a low and deep thumpthumpthump which echoed throughout the valley and seemed to grow louder as they advanced Then turning a corner of rock they saw before them a huge form which towered above the path for more than a hundred feet The form was that of a gigantic man built out of plates of cast iron and it stood with one foot on either side of the narrow road and swung over its right shoulder an immense iron mallet with which it constantly pounded the earth These resounding blows explained the thumping sounds they had heard for the mallet was much bigger than a barrel and where it struck the path between the rocky sides of the mountain it filled all the space thro
