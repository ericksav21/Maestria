lmost as hot as a bakeoven To their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flight of steps by means of which they could mount to the earths surface A sort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way and they found the floor of it both rough and steep Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow gallery where the buggy could not pass This delayed and bothered them for a while because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were good roads and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels they felt it their duty to preserve it So Zeb and the Wizard set to work and took off the wheels and the top and then they put the buggy edgewise so it would take up the smallest space In this position they managed with the aid of the patient cabhorse to drag the vehicle through the narrow part of the passage It was not a great distance fortunately and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together again and proceeded more comfortably But the road was nothing more than a series of rifts or cracks in the mountain and it went zigzag in every direction slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled as to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when they had started hours before Anyhow said Dorothy weve scaped those awful Gurgles and thats ONE comfort Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire returned the Wizard But even if they succeeded in doing that it would be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks so I am sure we need fear them no longer Once in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor which made the way quite dangerous but there was still enough oil in the lanterns to give them light and the cracks were not so wide but that they were able to jump over them Sometimes they had to climb over heaps of loose rock where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy At such times Dorothy Zeb and the Wizard all pushed behind and lifted the wheels over the roughest places so they managed by dint of hard work to keep going But the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last on turning a sharp corner the wanderers found themselves in a vast cave arching high over their heads and having a smooth level floor The cave was circular in shape and all around its edge near to the ground appeared groups of dull yellow lights two of them being always side by side These were motionless at first but soon began to flicker more brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down What sort of place is this asked the boy trying to see more clearly through the gloom I cannot imagine Im sure answered the Wizard also peering about Woogh snarled Eureka arching her back until her hair stood straight on end its den of alligators or crocodiles or some other dreadful creatures Dont you see their terrible eyes Eureka sees better in the dark than we can whispered Dorothy Tell us dear what do the creatures look like she asked addressing her pet I simply cant describe em answered the kitten shuddering Their eyes are like pieplates and their mouths like coalscuttles But their bodies dont seem very big Where are they enquired the girl They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern Oh Dorothyyou cant imagine what horrid things they are Theyre uglier than the Gargoyles Tuttut be careful how you criticise your neighbors spoke a rasping voice near by As a matter of fact you are rather uglylooking creatures yourselves and Im sure mother has often told us we were the loveliest and prettiest things in all the world Hearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound and the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one of the little pockets in the rock Why its a dragon he exclaimed No answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at them so steadily you are wrong about that We hope to grow to be dragons some day but just now were only dragonettes Whats that asked Dorothy gazing fearfully at the great scaley head the yawning mouth and the big eyes Young dragons of course but we are not allowed to call ourselves real dragons until we get our full growth was the reply The big dragons are very proud and dont think children amount to much but mother says that some day we will all be very powerful and important Where is your mother asked the Wizard anxiously looking around She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner If she has good luck she will bring us an elephant or a brace of rhinoceri or perhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger Oh are you hungry enquired Dorothy drawing back Very said the dragonette snapping its jaws Andanddo you eat people To be sure when we can get them But theyve been very scarce for a few years and we usually have to be content with elephants or buffaloes answered the creature in a regretful tone How old are you enquired Zeb who stared at the yellow eyes as if fascinated Qui
