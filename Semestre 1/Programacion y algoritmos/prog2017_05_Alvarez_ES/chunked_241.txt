it is quite simple Now I am what I am C4 a horse and quite satisfied but you with these emeralds may easily make a jackass of yourself so you had better tell me what you wish before you wish it For instance he went on reprovingly if instead of wishing yourself upon my back you had wished yourself a good horseman how much wiser that would have been Theres a lot more to riding than getting into the saddle you know But never mind that now What was this great big wish you and Matiah were planning together Leaning so far forward he almost lost his balance Skamperoo hurriedly whispered into Chalks left ear his grand and glorious wish for the future being careful to add to his own wish the three crafty suggestions made by the clever merchant You are sure this is what you desire Chalk looked sharply and a little sadly at the rotund and royal figure on his back You mean to go away and leave your own people without a thought or care Isnt there anyone here you would like to take along or give a share of your good fortune The King shook his head violently I might make a wish for Pinny Penny he added rather sheepishly Good idea sniffed Chalk What are you going to give old Skinny Pins You know I rather like that old codger Without delay and a bit spitefully the King told him and as this time Chalk found no fault with the wish Skamperoo again placed the emeralds over Chalks ear and quickly spoke nine words Then without waiting to see whether Pinny Penny got his wish Chalk again took command If you do exactly as I say well get off before Matiah discovers you are gone and comes down here to slice off your head to get his necklaces said the white horse severely Lowering his voice to a whisper he slowly enunciated four brief sentences Tingling partly with fright and partly with anticipation Skamperoo repeated the four sentences after Chalk and began his counting But stars Scarcely had he reached ten before he felt a great lift and lurch had just time to snatch back his emeralds and seize the reins before he and the huge white wishing horse without leaving even a rustle in the quiet air had gone vanished and completely disappeared from Skampavia CHAPTER 5 A GREAT CELEBRATION IN OZ Why all the crown jewels old Toz Resting his chin on the window ledge Highboy looked inquiringly into the dressing room of Joe King ruler of the Gillikens and all of the purple countries of Oz The Kings apartment was on the tenth floor of the royal palace but this made no difference to Highboy for Highboy was a giant horse whose telescope legs could be raised or lowered to any level making him one of the most amazing and amusing animals in Oz I say are we going anywhere in particular he drawled curiously as the King decked out in his best braided traveling coat and amethyst crown surveyed himself cheerfully in the long mirror WE chuckled the merry monarch turning round with a hearty roar Ho Ho HO And how do you know YOU are going Well I see you are wearing your best purple boots and when the King of all the Gillikens wears his best purple boots he usually rides his best purple horse does he not Right admitted the King good naturedly and I might as well tell you at once that we are going to the capital at the express invitation of her Imperial Highness Queen Ozma of Oz The King cleared his throat importantly There is to be an immense festival to celebrate the discovery of Oz by mortals the honors to be equally divided between the famous Wizard who arrived here in a balloon from Omaha many years ago and little Dorothy who came by way of a Kansas cyclone somewhat later Not only will the rulers of all four Oz Kingdoms be present but many other important and Royal personages as well Well Well indeed trumpeted the giant horse shrilly There you stand all shined up like a doorknob and never a word to me Howll I look Why wasnt I told before When do we start Just as soon as her Majesty decides what to wear and what to take with her answered the King with a solemn wink Oh then Ill have bushels of time Highboy sighed heavily with relief So were invited to the Emerald City eh How perfectly perf how simply magnif Billy Tommy JIM As he called the name of each little groom Highboy let himself down a couple of stories and by the time he reached a usual horse height and level on the ground he had ordered himself a bath a mane wave an oil shampoo and a hooficure Indeed Highboys plans for the party went on apace and with the three grooms pattering after him with buckets brushes and sponges he trotted anxiously up and down his great airy stable picking out his most splendid saddle and bridle and silverbraided blanket for the journey The giant horse wished to make an impression that would uphold if not enhance the honor and reputation of the Gillikens He was eager to renew his friendship with Trot a little mortal girl who lived in the palace and with Herby the Medicine Man and the many other interesting characters he had met on a former visit to the capital In the Munchki
