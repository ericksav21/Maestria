ecome overeducated and although I have a high respect for brains no matter how they may be arranged or classified I begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled In any event I must beg you to restrain your superior education while in our society We are not very particular added the Tin Woodman and we are exceedingly kind hearted But if your superior culture gets leaky again He did not complete the sentence but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that the WoggleBug looked frightened and shrank away to a safe distance The others marched on in silence and the Highly Magnified one after a period of deep thought said in an humble voice I will endeavor to restrain myself 162 That is all we can expect returned the Scarecrow pleasantly and good nature being thus happily restored to the party they proceeded upon their way When they again stopped to allow Tip to restthe boy being the only one that seemed to tirethe Tin Woodman noticed many small round holes in the grassy meadow This must be a village of the Field Mice he said to the Scarecrow I wonder if my old friend the Queen of the Mice is in this neighborhood If she is she may be of great service to us answered the Scarecrow who was impressed by a sudden thought See if you can call her my dear Nick So the Tin Woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung around his neck and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a nearby hole and advanced fearlessly toward them For the Tin Woodman had once saved her life and the Queen of the Field Mice knew he was to be trusted Good day your Majesty said Nick politely addressing the mouse I trust you are enjoying good health Thank you I am quite well answered the Queen demurely as she sat up and displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head Can I do anything to assist my old friends 163 You can indeed replied the Scarecrow eagerly Let me I intreat you take a dozen of your subjects with me to the Emerald City Will they be injured in any way asked the Queen doubtfully I think not replied the Scarecrow I will carry them hidden in the straw which stuffs my body and when I give them the signal by unbuttoning my jacket they have only to rush out and scamper home again as fast as they can By doing this they will assist me to regain my throne which the Army of Revolt has taken from me In that case said the Queen I will not refuse your request Whenever you are ready I will call twelve of my most intelligent subjects I am ready now returned the Scarecrow Then he lay flat upon the ground and unbuttoned his jacket displaying the mass of straw with which he was stuffed The Queen uttered a little piping call and in an instant a dozen pretty field mice had emerged from their holes and stood before their ruler awaiting her orders What the Queen said to them none of our travelers could understand for it was in the mouse language but the field mice obeyed without hesitation 164 running one after the other to the Scarecrow and hiding themselves in the straw of his breast When all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves the Scarecrow buttoned his Jacket securely and then arose and thanked the Queen for her kindness One thing more you might do to serve us suggested the Tin Woodman and that is to run ahead and show us the way to the Emerald City For some enemy is evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it I will do that gladly returned the Queen Are you ready The Tin Woodman looked at Tip Im rested said the boy Let us start Then they resumed their journey the little grey Queen of the Field Mice running swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew near when away she would dart again Without this unerring guide the Scarecrow and his comrades might never have gained the Emerald City for many were the obstacles thrown in their way by the arts of old Mombi Yet not one of the obstacles really existedall were cleverly contrived deceptions For when they came to the banks of a rushing river that threatened to bar their way the 165 little Queen kept steadily on passing through the seeming flood in safety and our travelers followed her without encountering a single drop of water Again a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and opposed their advance But the grey Field Mouse walked straight through it and the others did the same the wall melting into mist as they passed it Afterward when they had stopped for a moment to allow Tip to rest they saw forty roads branching off from their feet in forty different directions and soon these forty roads began whirling around like a mighty wheel first in one direction and then in the other completely bewildering their vision But the Queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a straight line and when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways vanished and were seen no more Mombis last trick was the most fearful of all She sent a sheet of crackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them and for the first time the Scarecrow became afraid and
