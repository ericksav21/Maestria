ith a short grunt Say havent we trouble enough at home without going to look for it Do you really propose to visit this tricky little metal monarch But Kaliko is not nearly so bad as Ruggedo Dorothy sat up and smoothed her dress earnestly Well just as you wish Pigasus shrugged his wings With me people are like eggs either good or bad Theres no such thing as a nearly good egg its got to be completely good or its just as bad as a bad egg Dye see And if this Gnome King is only as good as a nearly fresh egg I wouldnt trust him with my secondbest toothbrush My idea would be to go to the ruler of Ev Thats Evardo a boy King Ozma helped him too Dorothy explained importantly But I tell you Piggins lets not decide till we cross the Deadly Desert Something might turn up before then You never can tell No agreed the pig shaking his head sagely In Oz you never can Suppose we continue a ways on foot My wings are a bit stiff and we really should be on the lookout for a friendly house or castle where we could have supper and spend the night I could eat a peck of spinach or a bushel of apples right now so hop up my dear and Ill stretch a leg for the good of the coz and Oz Chattering away like the good fellow he was Pigasus trotted briskly across the fields and presently came to a deep rustling forest Shall we fly over or walk through questioned the pig sniffing appreciatively the cool air drifting out to them Lets go through it in a wood There might be witches some are good A good witch with her magic powers Could solve this mystery of ours But suppose we meet a bad one muttered Pigasus stepping gingerly into the forest and picking his way with great care between the giant trees Then well say goodbye and simply fly laughed Dorothy snapping her fingers joyfully Yes but flying would not be so easy in here objected Pigasus with a troubled glance aloft These branches are interlocked so closely Id stick in a tree like a kite Oh we probably wont meet anyone said Dorothy Slipping off his back she walked along beside him one arm flung cozily around his neck She was rather tired of making verses and thought she could think better if her head were not continually buzzing with rhymes After the hot sunny meadows the cool shade of the forest was very welcome but as they advanced farther and farther into the shadows it grew so dark and grim the two began to look at each other in real alarm Must be a squall or thundershower brewing observed Pigasus in a faint voice Yes it couldnt be nighttime so soon agreed Dorothy looking fearfully over her shoulder The crackling of twigs as some large animal made its way through the brush sounded like gunfire and while they were trying to make up their minds whether to run back or push forward a long hollow roar sent them skittering forward practically as one Missing trees by mere inches they pelted at breakneck speed into the dense and even gloomier stretch of woodland ahead Bbbbetter climb on my back directed Pigasus halting at last from lack of breath rather than inclination But where are you I cant even see you wailed Dorothy feeling about wildly Here here grunted the frantic pig making short dashes in four or five directions and finally bumping violently into the groping little girl Snatching at a wing Dorothy pulled herself thankfully up and clasped both arms round his neck In a tense and breathless silence they waited for it to grow lighter They could not see even an inch before their noses now and the darkness and silence grew more oppressive and unbearable every minute Jjjjust a cloud passing over croaked Pigasus trying to keep his teeth from chattering JjjjFF20C4 Say whats that Dorothy do you hear anything Fffootsteps C4 not four TWO Someones coming Hello there Who are you Watch out now were here I see you answered a flat matteroffact voice Oh He sees us yet we cant see him Im frightened deaf and dumb Oh try to fly Pigasus why Oh whyd we ever come Thats what Id like to know went on the voice sternly Now then will you come quietly or must I drag you along CHAPTER 10 THE WITCH OF THE BLACK FOREST Dorothy and her companion were too stunned to answer and in two thumping steps the owner of the voice was upon them Do you dare to defy a member of the Invincible Black Watch breathed the stranger grasping Pigasus roughly by the right wing No No We dont exactly defy you squealed the pig flapping his other wing frantically but how can we follow a blackguard whom we cannot even see Then how do you know I am a blackguard demanded their captor suspiciously From your voice screamed Pigasus jerking this way and that way in an effort to free himself Id know you for a blackguard anywhere Unhand me you surly black monster You talk a lot for a fellow who cannot see scoffed the Guard tightening his grip on the pigs wing Is the girl blind too Were not blind at all and why should we be In this horrid black forest how could we see cried Dorothy her indignation getting the better of her fright Well what color are your
