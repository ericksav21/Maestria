he sides of the boat and scarcely dared to breathe The sand lay in billows and was in places very uneven so that the boat rocked dangerously from side to side but it never quite tipped over and the speed was so great that the shaggy man himself became frightened and began to wonder how he could make the ship go slower It were spilled in this sand in the middle of the desert Dorothy thought to herself well be nothing but dust in a few minutes and that will be the end of us But they were not spilled and byandby Polychrome who was clinging to the bow and looking straight ahead saw a dark line before them and wondered what it was It grew plainer every second until she discovered it to be a row of jagged rocks at the end of the desert while high above these rocks she could see a tableland of green grass and beautiful trees Look out she screamed to the shaggy man Go slowly or we shall smash into the rocks He heard her and tried to pull down the sail but the wind would not let go of the broad canvas and the ropes had become tangled Nearer and nearer they drew to the great rocks and the shaggy man was in despair because he could do nothing to stop the wild rush of the sandboat They reached the edge of the desert and bumped squarely into the rocks There was a crash as Dorothy ButtonBright Toto and Polly flew up in the air in a curve like a skyrockets one after another landing high upon the grass where they rolled and tumbled for a time before they could stop themselves The shaggy man flew after them head first and lighted in a heap beside Toto who being much excited at the time seized one of the donkey ears between his teeth and shook and worried it as hard as he could growling angrily The shaggy man made the little dog let go and sat up to look around him Dorothy was feeling one of her front teeth which was loosened by knocking against her knee as she fell Polly was looking sorrowfully at a rent in her pretty gauze gown and ButtonBrights fox head had stuck fast in a gopher hole and he was wiggling his little fat legs frantically in an effort to get free Otherwise they were unhurt by the adventure so the shaggy man stood up and pulled ButtonBright out of the hole and went to the edge of the desert to look at the sandboat It was a mere mass of splinters now crushed out of shape against the rocks The wind had torn away the sail and carried it to the top of a tall tree where the fragments of it fluttered like a white flag Well he said cheerfully were here but where the here is I dont know It must be some part of the Land of Oz observed Dorothy coming to his side Must it Course it must Were across the desert arent we And somewhere in the middle of Oz is the Emerald City To be sure said the shaggy man nodding Lets go there But I dont see any people about to show us the way she continued Lets hunt for them he suggested There must be people somewhere but perhaps they did not expect us and so are not at hand to give us a welcome 13 The Truth Pond They now made a more careful examination of the country around them All was fresh and beautiful after the sultriness of the desert and the sunshine and sweet crisp air were delightful to the wanderers Little mounds of yellowish green were away at the right while on the left waved a group of tall leafy trees bearing yellow blossoms that looked like tassels and pompoms Among the grasses carpeting the ground were pretty buttercups and cowslips and marigolds After looking at these a moment Dorothy said reflectively We must be in the Country of the Winkies for the color of that country is yellow and you will notice that most everything here is yellow that has any color at all But I thought this was the Land of Oz replied the shaggy man as if greatly disappointed So it is she declared but there are four parts to the Land of Oz The North Country is purple and its the Country of the Gillikins The East Country is blue and thats the Country of the Munchkins Down at the South is the red Country of the Quadlings and here in the West the yellow Country of the Winkies This is the part that is ruled by the Tin Woodman you know Whos he asked ButtonBright Why hes the tin man I told you about His name is Nick Chopper and he has a lovely heart given him by the wonderful Wizard Where does HE live asked the boy The Wizard Oh he lives in the Emerald City which is just in the middle of Oz where the corners of the four countries meet Oh said ButtonBright puzzled by this explanation We must be some distance from the Emerald City remarked the shaggy man Thats true she replied so wed better start on and see if we can find any of the Winkies Theyre nice people she continued as the little party began walking toward the group of trees and I came here once with my friends the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion to fight a wicked witch who had made all the Winkies her slaves Did you conquer her asked Polly Why I melted her with a bucket of water and that was the end of her replied Dorothy After th
