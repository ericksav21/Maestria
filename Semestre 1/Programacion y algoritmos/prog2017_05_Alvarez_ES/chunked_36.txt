great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors These houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothys waist There were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country There were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed caps And strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothys knee No one did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extralarge head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice afterwards running away again How shall we get down asked Dorothy They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side said Dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South They began walking through the country of the china people and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow As they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow There cried the milkmaid angrily See what you have done My cow has broken her leg and I must take her to the menders shop and have it glued on again What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow Im very sorry returned Dorothy Please forgive us But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap We must be very careful here said the kindhearted Woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess so she ran after her But the china girl cried out Dont chase me Dont chase me She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said Why not Because answered the Princess also stopping a safe distance away if I run I may fall down and break myself But could you not be mended asked the girl Oh yes but one is never so pretty after being mended you know replied the Princess I suppose not said Dorothy Now there is Mr Joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to stand upon his head He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesnt look at all pretty Here he comes now so you can see for yourself Indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places The Clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said My lady fair Why do you stare At poor old Mr Joker Youre quite as stiff And prim as if Youd eaten up a poker Be quiet sir said the Princess Cant you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect Well thats respect I expect declared the Clown and immediately stood upon his head Dont mind Mr Joker said the Princess to Dorothy He is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish Oh I dont mind him a bit said Dorothy But you are so beautiful she continued that I am sure I could love you dearly Wont you let me carry you back to Kansas and stand you on Aunt Ems mantel I could carry you in my basket That would make me
