nd escaped through an archwaynever pausing in her wild career until she had reached the city gates So in less time than I can explain the throne room was deserted by all save the Scarecrow and his friends and the WoggleBug heaved a deep sigh of relief as he exclaimed Thank goodness we are saved For a time yes answered the Tin Woodman But the enemy will soon return I fear Let us bar all the entrances to the palace said the Scarecrow Then we shall have time to think what is best to be done 179 So all except Jack Pumpkinhead who was still tied fast to the SawHorse ran to the various entrances of the royal palace and closed the heavy doors bolting and locking them securely Then knowing that the Army of Revolt could not batter down the barriers in several days the adventurers gathered once more in the throne room for a council of war LineArt Drawing 180 Full page lineart drawing 181 The Scarecrow Takes Time to Think It seems to me began the Scarecrow when all were again assembled in the throne room that the girl Jinjur is quite right in claiming to be Queen And if she is right then I am wrong and we have no business to be occupying her palace But you were the King until she came said the WoggleBug strutting up and down with his hands in his pockets so it appears to me that she is the interloper instead of you Especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight added the Pumpkinhead as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the Scarecrow Have we really conquered her asked the Scarecrow quietly Look out of the window and tell me what you see 182 Tip ran to the window and looked out The palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers he announced I thought so returned the Scarecrow We are as truly their prisoners as we were before the mice frightened them from the palace My friend is right said Nick Chopper who had been polishing his breast with a bit of chamoisleather Jinjur is still the Queen and we are her prisoners But I hope she cannot get at us exclaimed the Pumpkinhead with a shiver of fear She threatened to make tarts of me you know Dont worry said the Tin Woodman It cannot matter greatly If you stay shut up here you will spoil in time anyway A good tart is far more admirable than a decayed intellect Very true agreed the Scarecrow Oh dear moaned Jack what an unhappy lot is mine Why dear father did you not make me out of tinor even out of strawso that I would keep indefinitely Shucks returned Tip indignantly You ought to be glad that I made you at all Then he added reflectively everything has to come to an end some time 183 But I beg to remind you broke in the WoggleBug who had a distressed look in his bulging round eyes that this terrible Queen Jinjur suggested making a goulash of meMe the only Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated WoggleBug in the wide wide world I think it was a brilliant idea remarked the Scarecrow approvingly Dont you imagine he would make a better soup asked the Tin Woodman turning toward his friend Well perhaps acknowledged the Scarecrow The WoggleBug groaned I can see in my minds eye said he mournfully the goats eating small pieces of my dear comrade the Tin Woodman while my soup is being cooked on a bonfire built of the SawHorse and Jack Pumpkinheads body and Queen Jinjur watches me boil while she feeds the flames with my friend the Scarecrow This morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party making them restless and anxious It cant happen for some time said the Tin Woodman trying to speak cheerfully for we shall be able to keep Jinjur out of the palace until she manages to break down the doors 184 And in the meantime I am liable to starve to death and so is the Woggle Bug announced Tip As for me said the WoggleBug I think that I could live for some time on Jack Pumpkinhead Not that I prefer pumpkins for food but I believe they are somewhat nutritious and Jacks head is large and plump How heartless exclaimed the Tin Woodman greatly shocked Are we cannibals let me ask Or are we faithful friends I see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace said the Scarecrow with decision So let us end this mournful talk and try to discover a means to escape At this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne wherein was seated the Scarecrow and as Tip sat down upon a stool there fell from his pocket a pepperbox which rolled upon the floor What is this asked Nick Chopper picking up the box Be careful cried the boy Thats my Powder of Life Dont spill it for it is nearly gone And what is the Powder of Life enquired the Scarecrow as Tip replaced the box carefully in his pocket Its some magical stuff old Mombi got from a 185 crooked sorcerer explained the boy She brought Jack to life with it and afterward I used it to bring the SawHorse to life I guess it will make anything live that is sprinkled with it but theres only about one dose left Then it is very precious said the Tin Woodman Indeed it is agreed the Scarecrow It may prove our best means of e
