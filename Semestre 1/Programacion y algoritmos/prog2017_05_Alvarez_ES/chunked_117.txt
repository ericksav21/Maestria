run away again I will have her reduce all the twentysix officers to privates and make the private your general This terrible threat so frightened them that they at once returned to where Ozma was standing beside the Cowardly Lion Then Ozma cried out in a loud voice I demand that the Nome King appear to us There was no reply except that the shifting Nomes upon the mountain laughed in derision You must not command the Nome King said Tiktok for you do not rule him as you do your own people So Ozma called again saying I request the Nome King to appear to us Only the mocking laughter replied to her and the shadowy Nomes continued to flit here and there upon the rocky cliff Try entreaty said Tiktok to Ozma If he will not come at your request then the Nome King may listen to your pleading Ozma looked around her proudly Do you wish your ruler to plead with this wicked Nome King she asked Shall Ozma of Oz humble herself to a creature who lives in an underground kingdom No they all shouted with big voices and the Scarecrow added If he will not come we will dig him out of his hole like a fox and conquer his stubbornness But our sweet little ruler must always maintain her dignity just as I maintain mine Im not afraid to plead with him said Dorothy Im only a little girl from Kansas and weve got more dignity at home than we know what to do with ILL call the Nome King Do said the Hungry Tiger and if he makes hash of you Ill willingly eat you for breakfast tomorrow morning So Dorothy stepped forward and said PLEASE Mr Nome King come here and see us The Nomes started to laugh again but a low growl came from the mountain and in a flash they had all vanished from sight and were silent Then a door in the rock opened and a voice cried Enter Isnt it a trick asked the Tin Woodman Never mind replied Ozma We came here to rescue the poor Queen of Ev and her ten children and we must run some risks to do so The Nome King is honest and good natured said Tiktok You can trust him to do what is right So Ozma led the way hand in hand with Dorothy and they passed through the arched doorway of rock and entered a long passage which was lighted by jewels set in the walls and having lamps behind them There was no one to escort them or to show them the way but all the party pressed through the passage until they came to a round domed cavern that was grandly furnished In the center of this room was a throne carved out of a solid boulder of rock rude and rugged in shape but glittering with great rubies and diamonds and emeralds on every part of its surface And upon the throne sat the Nome King This important monarch of the Underground World was a little fat man clothed in graybrown garments that were the exact color of the rock throne in which he was seated His bushy hair and flowing beard were also colored like the rocks and so was his face He wore no crown of any sort and his only ornament was a broad jewelstudded belt that encircled his fat little body As for his features they seemed kindly and good humored and his eyes were turned merrily upon his visitors as Ozma and Dorothy stood before him with their followers ranged in close order behind them Why he looks just like Santa Clausonly he isnt the same color whispered Dorothy to her friend but the Nome King heard the speech and it made him laugh aloud He had a red face and a round little belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly quoth the monarch in a pleasant voice and they could all see that he really did shake like jelly when he laughed Both Ozma and Dorothy were much relieved to find the Nome King so jolly and a minute later he waved his right hand and the girls each found a cushioned stool at her side Sit down my dears said the King and tell me why you have come all this way to see me and what I can do to make you happy While they seated themselves the Nome King picked up a pipe and taking a glowing red coal out of his pocket he placed it in the bowl of the pipe and began puffing out clouds of smoke that curled in rings above his head Dorothy thought this made the little monarch look more like Santa Claus than ever but Ozma now began speaking and every one listened intently to her words Your Majesty said she I am the ruler of the Land of Oz and I have come here to ask you to release the good Queen of Ev and her ten children whom you have enchanted and hold as your prisoners Oh no you are mistaken about that replied the King They are not my prisoners but my slaves whom I purchased from the King of Ev But that was wrong said Ozma According to the laws of Ev the king can do no wrong answered the monarch eying a ring of smoke he had just blown from his mouth so that he had a perfect right to sell his family to me in exchange for a long life You cheated him though declared Dorothy for the King of Ev did not have a long life He jumped into the sea and was drowned That was not my fault said the Nome King crossing his legs and smiling contentedly I gave him the long life all right
