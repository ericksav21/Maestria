out and wont pass under that mallet again The officers at once protested that they must have the private with them else there would be no one for them to command But neither the Lion or the Tiger would go after him and so the Scarecrow sent the Sawhorse Either the wooden horse was careless or it failed to properly time the descent of the hammer for the mighty weapon caught it squarely upon its head and thumped it against the ground so powerfully that the private flew off its back high into the air and landed upon one of the giants castiron arms Here he clung desperately while the arm rose and fell with each one of the rapid strokes The Scarecrow dashed in to rescue his Sawhorse and had his left foot smashed by the hammer before he could pull the creature out of danger They then found that the Sawhorse had been badly dazed by the blow for while the hard wooden knot of which his head was formed could not be crushed by the hammer both his ears were broken off and he would be unable to hear a sound until some new ones were made for him Also his left knee was cracked and had to be bound up with a string Billina having fluttered under the hammer it now remained only to rescue the private who was riding upon the iron giants arm high in the air The Scarecrow lay flat upon the ground and called to the man to jump down upon his body which was soft because it was stuffed with straw This the private managed to do waiting until a time when he was nearest the ground and then letting himself drop upon the Scarecrow He accomplished the feat without breaking any bones and the Scarecrow declared he was not injured in the least Therefore the Tin Woodman having by this time fitted new ears to the Sawhorse the entire party proceeded upon its way leaving the giant to pound the path behind them 11 The Nome King By and by when they drew near to the mountain that blocked their path and which was the furthermost edge of the Kingdom of Ev the way grew dark and gloomy for the reason that the high peaks on either side shut out the sunshine And it was very silent too as there were no birds to sing or squirrels to chatter the trees being left far behind them and only the bare rocks remaining Ozma and Dorothy were a little awed by the silence and all the others were quiet and grave except the Sawhorse which as it trotted along with the Scarecrow upon his back hummed a queer song of which this was the chorus Would a wooden horse in a woodland go Aye aye I sigh he would although Had he not had a wooden head Hed mount the mountain top instead But no one paid any attention to this because they were now close to the Nome Kings dominions and his splendid underground palace could not be very far away Suddenly they heard a shout of jeering laughter and stopped short They would have to stop in a minute anyway for the huge mountain barred their further progress and the path ran close up to a wall of rock and ended Who was that laughing asked Ozma There was no reply but in the gloom they could see strange forms flit across the face of the rock Whatever the creations might be they seemed very like the rock itself for they were the color of rocks and their shapes were as rough and rugged as if they had been broken away from the side of the mountain They kept close to the steep cliff facing our friends and glided up and down and this way and that with a lack of regularity that was quite confusing And they seemed not to need places to rest their feet but clung to the surface of the rock as a fly does to a windowpane and were never still for a moment Do not mind them said Tiktok as Dorothy shrank back They are only the Nomes And what are Nomes asked the girl half frightened They are rock fairies and serve the Nome King replied the machine But they will do us no harm You must call for the King because without him you can never find the entrance to the palace YOU call said Dorothy to Ozma Just then the Nomes laughed again and the sound was so weird and disheartening that the twentysix officers commanded the private to rightaboutface and they all started to run as fast as they could The Tin Woodman at once pursued his army and cried halt and when they had stopped their flight he asked Where are you going II find Ive forgotten the brush for my whiskers said a general trembling with fear Ssso we are ggoing back after it That is impossible replied the Tin Woodman For the giant with the hammer would kill you all if you tried to pass him Oh Id forgotten the giant said the general turning pale You seem to forget a good many things remarked the Tin Woodman I hope you wont forget that you are brave men Never cried the general slapping his goldembroidered chest Never cried all the other officers indignantly slapping their chests For my part said the private meekly I must obey my officers so when I am told to run I run and when I am told to fight I fight That is right agreed the Tin Woodman And now you must all come back to Ozma and obey HER orders And if you try to
