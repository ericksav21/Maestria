round again before they had decided to pass over But they knew now that there was a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appeared for the second time The children and the Wizard rushed across the moving rock and sprang into the passage beyond landing safely though a little out of breath Jim the cabhorse came last and the rocky wall almost caught him for just as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swung across it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fell into the narrow crack where the rock turned and became wedged there They heard a crunching grinding sound a loud snap and the turntable came to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path from which they had come Never mind said Zeb we dont want to get back anyhow Im not so sure of that returned Dorothy The mother dragon may come down and catch us here It is possible agreed the Wizard if this proves to be the path she usually takes But I have been examining this tunnel and I do not see any signs of so large a beast having passed through it Then were all right said the girl for if the dragon went the other way she cant possbly get to us now Of course not my dear But there is another thing to consider The mother dragon probably knows the road to the earths surface and if she went the other way then we have come the wrong way said the Wizard thoughtfully Dear me cried Dorothy That would be unlucky wouldnt it Very Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth said Zeb For my part if we manage to get out of here Ill be glad it isnt the way the dragon goes So will I returned Dorothy Its enough to have your pedigree flung in your face by those saucy dragonettes No one knows what the mother might do They now moved on again creeping slowly up another steep incline The lanterns were beginning to grow dim and the Wizard poured the remaining oil from one into the other so that the one light would last longer But their journey was almost over for in a short time they reached a small cave from which there was no further outlet They did not realize their ill fortune at first for their hearts were gladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crack in the roof of the cave far overhead That meant that their worldthe real worldwas not very far away and that the succession of perilous adventures they had encountered had at last brought them near the earths surface which meant home to them But when the adventurers looked more carefully around them they discovered that there were in a strong prison from which there was no hope of escape But were ALMOST on earth again cried Dorothy for there is the sunthe most BEAUFUL sun that shines and she pointed eagerly at the crack in the distant roof Almost on earth isnt being there said the kitten in a discontented tone It wouldnt be possible for even me to get up to that crackor through it if I got there It appears that the path ends here announced the Wizard gloomily And there is no way to go back added Zeb with a low whistle of perplexity I was sure it would come to this in the end remarked the old cabhorse Folks dont fall into the middle of the earth and then get back again to tell of their adventuresnot in real life And the whole thing has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to talk your language and to understand the words you say And so can the nine tiny piglets added Eureka Dont forget them for I may have to eat them after all Ive heard animals talk before said Dorothy and no harm came of it Were you ever before shut up in a cave far under the earth with no way of getting out enquired the horse seriously No answered Dorothy But dont you lose heart Jim for Im sure this isnt the end of our story by any means The reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had not enjoyed much exercise lately and must be tired of their prison in his pocket So he sat down upon the floor of the cave brought the piglets out one by one and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased My dears he said to them Im afraid Ive got you into a lot of trouble and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy cave Whats wrong asked a piglet Weve been in the dark quite a while and you may as well explain what has happened The Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers Well said another piglet you are a wizard are you not I am replied the little man Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole declared the tiny one with much confidence I could if I happened to be a real wizard returned the master sadly But Im not my piggywees Im a humbug wizard Nonsense cried several of the piglets together You can ask Dorothy said the little man in an injured tone Its true enough returned the girl earnestly Our friend Oz is merely a humbug wizard for he once proved it to me He can do several very wonderful thingsif he knows how But he cant wiz a single thing if he hasnt the tools and machinery to work wit
