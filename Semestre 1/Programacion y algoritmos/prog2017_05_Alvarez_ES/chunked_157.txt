Quick To the water or you are lost cried their unseen friend and without hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon the broad river for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in her arms They did not sink at all owing to the virtues of the strange plant they had used and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream the Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim The horse was plunging madly about and two or three deep gashes appeared upon its flanks from which the blood flowed freely Run for the river shouted the Wizard and Jim quickly freed himself from his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed As soon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himself safe from pursuit and Zeb was already running across the water toward Dorothy As the little Wizard turned to follow them he felt a hot breath against his cheek and heard a low fierce growl At once he began stabbing at the air with his sword and he knew that he had struck some substance because when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood The third time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a fall and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer The beast was quite dead from the sword thrusts and after a glance at its terrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic and rushed out upon the water for other menacing growls told him more bears were near On the river however the adventurers seemed to be perfectly safe Dorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current of the water and the others made haste to join her The Wizard opened his satchel and got out some stickingplaster with which he mended the cuts Jim had received from the claws of the bears I think wed better stick to the river after this said Dorothy If our unknown friend hadnt warned us and told us what to do we would all be dead by this time That is true agreed the Wizard and as the river seems to be flowing in the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest way for us to travel Zeb hitched Jim to the buggy again and the horse trotted along and drew them rapidly over the smooth water The kitten was at first dreadfully afraid of getting wet but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka was frisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit Once a little fish swam too near the surface and the kitten grabbed it in her mouth and ate it up as quick as a wink but Dorothy cautioned her to be careful what she ate in this valley of enchantments and no more fishes were careless enough to swim within reach After a journey of several hours they came to a point where the river curved and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley before they came to the Pyramid Mountain There were few houses in this part and few orchards or flowers so our friends feared they might encounter more of the savage bears which they had learned to dread with all their hearts Youll have to make a dash Jim said the Wizard and run as fast as you can go All right answered the horse Ill do my best But you must remember Im old and my dashing days are past and gone All three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins though Jim needed no guidance of any sort The horse was still smarting from the sharp claws of the invisible bears and as soon as he was on land and headed toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome creatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in a way that made Dorothy catch her breath Then Zeb in a spirit of mischief uttered a growl like that of the bears and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew His boney legs moved so fast they could scarcely be seen and the Wizard clung fast to the seat and yelled Whoa at the top of his voice IIm fraid heshes running away gasped Dorothy I KNOW he is said Zeb but no bear can catch him if he keeps up that gaitand the harness or the buggy dont break Jim did not make a mile a minute but almost before they were aware of it he drew up at the foot of the mountain so suddenly that the Wizard and Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the soft grasswhere they rolled over several times before they stopped Dorothy nearly went with them but she was holding fast to the iron rail of the seat and that saved her She squeezed the kitten though until it screeched and then the old cabhorse made several curious sounds that led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all 10 The Braided Man of Pyramid Mountain The mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its point was lost in the clouds Directly facing the place where Jim had stopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway The stairs were cut in the rock inside the mountain and they were broad and not very steep because they circled around like a corkscrew and at the arched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big
