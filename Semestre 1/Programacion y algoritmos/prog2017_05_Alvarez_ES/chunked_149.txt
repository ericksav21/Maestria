e Wizard looking at his pets in astonishment They can actually talk May I eat one of them asked the kitten in a pleading voice Im awfully hungry Why Eureka said Dorothy reproachfully what a cruel question It would be dreadful to eat these dear little things I should say so grunted another of the piglets looking uneasily at the kitten cats are cruel things Im not cruel replied the kitten yawning Im just hungry You cannot eat my piglets even if you are starving declared the little man in a stern voice They are the only things I have to prove Im a wizard How did they happen to be so little asked Dorothy I never saw such small pigs before They are from the Island of TeentyWeent said the Wizard where everything is small because its a small island A sailor brought them to Los Angeles and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them But what am I going to eat wailed the kitten sitting in front of Dorothy and looking pleadingly into her face There are no cows here to give milk or any mice or even grasshoppers And if I cant eat the piglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup I have an idea said the Wizard that there are fishes in these brooks Do you like fish Fish cried the kitten Do I like fish Why theyre better than pigletsor even milk Then Ill try to catch you some said he But wont they be vegtable like everything else here asked the kitten I think not Fishes are not animals and they are as cold and moist as the vegetables themselves There is no reason that I can see why they may not exist in the waters of this strange country Then the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string from his pocket for a fishline The only bait he could find was a bright red blossom from a flower but he knew fishes are easy to fool if anything bright attracts their attention so he decided to try the blossom Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby brook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was caught on the bent pin so the little man drew in the string and sure enough the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore where it began to flop around in great excitement The fish was fat and round and its scales glistened like beautifully cut jewels set close together but there was no time to examine it closely for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws and in a few moments it had entirely disappeared Oh Eureka cried Dorothy did you eat the bones If it had any bones I ate them replied the kitten composedly as it washed its face after the meal But I dont think that fish had any bones because I didnt feel them scratch my throat You were very greedy said the girl I was very hungry replied the kitten The little pigs had stood huddled in a group watching this scene with frightened eyes Cats are dreadful creatures said one of them Im glad we are not fishes said another Dont worry Dorothy murmured soothingly Ill not let the kitten hurt you Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suitcase were one or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train and she went to the buggy and brought them Eureka stuck up her nose at such food but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the crackers and ate them up in a jiffy Now let us go back to the city suggested the Wizard That is if Jim has had enough of the pink grass The cabhorse who was browsing near lifted his head with a sigh Ive tried to eat a lot while I had the chance said he for its likely to be a long while between meals in this strange country But Im ready to go now at any time you wish So after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket where they cuddled up and went to sleep the three climbed into the buggy and Jim started back to the town Where shall we stay asked the girl I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer replied the Wizard for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he would keep me until they picked another Sorcerer and the new Princess wont know but that we belong there They agreed to this plan and when they reached the great square Jim drew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall It doesnt look very homelike said Dorothy gazing around at the bare room But its a place to stay anyhow What are those holes up there enquired the boy pointing to some openings that appeared near the top of the dome They look like doorways said Dorothy only there are no stairs to get to them You forget that stairs are unnecessary observed the Wizard Let us walk up and see where the doors lead to With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings and Dorothy and Zeb followed him It was the same sort of climb one experiences when walking up a hill and they were nearly out of breath when they came to the row of openings which they perceived to be doorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house Following these halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them and some were furnished with glass b
