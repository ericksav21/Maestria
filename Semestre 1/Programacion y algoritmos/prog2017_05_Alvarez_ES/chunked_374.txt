no bodies on em no bodies at all Read the sign directed Kabumpo uncurling his trunk and pointing to a crude warning scratched on a flat slab at the edge of the road leading to the rocky promontory above Heads up This road leads to Headland nobodys allowed Humph Well we wont make much headway without our bodies grunted Kabumpo as Randy read the message slowly to himself Such impudence Why should we pay any attention to such stuff Bodies or not were going on and how can fellows minus feet and arms hope to stop us They might crash down on us with their heads worried Randy as an angry flock of Headmen circled round and round at the top of the road and those heads look hard Not any harder than mine Keep your crown on Randy advised Kabumpo grimly The spikes will dent em good and if you reach down in my lefthand pocket youll find a short club The club will be better than your sword you cant cut a head off no neck and besides we dont really want to injure the pests All ready Then here we go Randy did not answer for hooking his heels through Kabumpos harness he was already delving into the capacious pockets on the left side of the Elegant Elephants robe discovering not only a club but a quiver full of darts Jerking himself upright the club in one hand and the darts in the other he peered aloft with growing anxiety as foot over foot Kabumpo climbed up the granite slope The faces of the Headmen were round and deeply wrinkled from the hot winds blowing off the desert their ears huge and fanshaped flapped like wings and like wings propelled them through the air Before Kabumpo reached the top a whole bevy came whizzing toward them screaming out indignant threats and warnings Off be off they shouted hysterically Off with their arms off with their legs off with their bodies Halt Stop Begone you miserable creepycrawly creatures You dare not set a foot on our beautiful Headland Oh darent we Kabumpo shook his trunk belligerently And who is to stop us pray I am rasped the ugliest of the Headmen Snatching a coil of wire from a niche in the rocks with his teeth the ugly little Mugly came flapping toward them Another of the Headmen hastened to seize the opposite end of the wire in his teeth and stretching it between them they came rushing on Watch out warned Randy dropping flat between Kabumpos ears Theyre going to trip you up Wrong how wrong chattered all the Headmen bobbing up and down like balloons let off their strings Theyre going to cut off his body confided one of the longnosed tribesmen zooming down to whisper this information in Randys ear The creatures head is welcome enough and with those enormous ears hell have no trouble at all flying but his body C4 oh his body is awful and must stay behind And your body too you little monster well cut that off too promised the Headman in his oily voice What use is a body anyway I see you have very small ears but they can be stretched And just wait till youve been debodicated Youll feel so right and light and flighty Help Stop Help Help screamed Randy as the ugly Mugly gave him a playful nip on the ear Back up Kabumpo back down Theyre going to catch you in that wire and choke you Oah Nonsense panted the Elegant Elephant And heaving himself up over the last barrier he stepped confidently out on the rocky plateau Heads up Heads up shrilled the Headmen while the two with the wire deftly encircling Kabumpos great neck began to fly apart in order to draw the noose tighter Kabumpo ducked but much too late and though his ferocious trumpeting sent swarms of Headmen fluttering aloft the two holding the wire stuck to their task pulling and jerking with all their might till Kabumpos jeweled collar was pressing uncomfortably into his throat Dont worry he grunted gamely their teeth will give way before my neck goes Calm yourself my boy caalm yourself But how could Randy feel calm with his best friend in such a predicament and already beginning to gasp for breath Jumping up and down on Kabumpos back he rattled his club valiantly but the Headmen were too high for him to reach and when at last he flung the club with all his strength at the one on the left it seemed to make no impression at all on the hard head of the enemy Redoubling his efforts he drew the wire tighter and tighter in his yellow teeth In desperation Randy suddenly remembered the darts and drawing one from the quiver sent it speeding upward The first missed but as the Elegant Elephant began to sway and quiver beneath him the second found its mark striking the Headman squarely in the middle of the forehead An expression of surprise and dismay overspread his wrinkled features and next instant with a terrific yawn he dropped the wire and fell headlong to the rocks where he rolled over and over and over Great Goopers exclaimed Randy hardly able to believe his luck Why hes not hurt at all but has fallen asleep Watch the others the C4 others gulped Kabumpo shaking his head in an effort to free it from the wire Already another had flown to
