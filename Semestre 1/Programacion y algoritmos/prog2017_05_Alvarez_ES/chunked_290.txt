 and porgy and tender young sea shoots Why that foams as near to whipping cream as anything Ive ever gazed on Tearing himself reluctantly from the appetizing sight the Royal Cook padded off to put the galley in order for the night while Roger with loud squalls of glee dropped the plates and saucers one by one over the side In this way the dishes were soon done the cabin tidy and shipshape and by eight bells the King and the Read Bird were sleeping soundly and Samuel Salt had the ship all to himself First he made a complete round of all decks glanced at the barometer and compass and furled the fore and mizzen topsails Then he took the cooled piece of lava down to the hold The strange signs and symbols had hardened and labeling it carefully with the date and name of Salamander Island Samuel placed it on his shelves for further study Then returning to the main deck he set a portable ships lantern on a coil of rope and settled down to fix a hotbox for the Salamander Selecting from the material he had brought from the hold an iron box with a glass lid he covered the bottom with sand and pebbles Knowing salamanders require hot water as well as hot air he placed a tiny flat pan of water in the corner of the box to serve as a swimming pool A burning glass in the daytime and an alcohol lamp under the box at night would supply the necessary heat and setting the whole contrivance on an iron tray in the cabin Samuel went joyfully off to fetch the fire lizard The Salamander was still in the pot on the back of the stove and giving her an experimental poke with his finger Samuel was astonished to find her quite cool to the touch This was surprising considering she could only live in the most intense heat But without stopping to figure it out the Captain picked her up between thumb and forefinger carried her to the cabin and popped her into the iron box He had already lighted the lamp under the box so that everything was redhot and cozy for her The small captive seemed to appreciate her new quarters wriggling over the hot pebbles and sand then splashing gaily in her swimming pool Quite a girl sighed the pirate resting his elbows on the table and gazing happily down at the first prize of the voyage Youre going to be great company for me Sally As if she really understood the lizard gave a squeak and tapped loudly on the glass lid with her tail The pipe almost dropped from Samuels mouth at Sallys strange behavior and lifting the lid he peered inquisitively down at her Before he had a chance to clap it shut the Salamander hurled herself upward landing smartly on the bridge of the Pirates nose from where she slid cleverly into the pipe itself Well Ill be scuppered gasped the Royal Explorer looking slightly crosseyed down the bridge of his nose as Sally coiled up comfortably in the bowl of the pipe The little rascal wants to keep me company and so she shall bless my boots so she shall Why this is plumb cute and cozy and something to write in my journal Puffing away delightedly Samuel stepped out of the cabin and all during his watch the little Salamander rested contentedly in his pipe Sometimes she peered up inquisitively over the edge but mostly she lay quietly on the smoking tobacco looking with calm interest up at the sky and the rippling sails over her head Not only did she keep his pipe from going out but never had it drawn so well So filled with a vast wonder and content Samuel strode up and down the deck Not till midnight when he roused Ato could he bear to put Sally back in her box and only then after he had promised her another ride in the morning But when morning came Samuel had no time to keep his promise for while Ato was cooking breakfast and the Captain himself catching forty winks in the cabin the raucous voice of the Read Bird came whistling down from the foremast Land Ho Land More Land Island tuluward Captain CHAPTER 5 PATRIPPANY ISLAND All hands on deck Come on Come on yelled Samuel Salt running past Atos galley dragging on his clothes as he ran Theres an island tuluward you lubber Well taint a flying island is it Ato stuck a very red face out the door I guess itll stay there till I turn the bacon wont it No cause to burn the biscuits just cause an islands sighted is there But in spite of his pretended indifference the ships cook shoved all his pans on the back of the stove and hurried out on deck Rich and jungly this one he observed resting his arms comfortably on the rail and from what I can see a good place to grow bananas and whiskers Look Sammy even the trees have beards Moss muttered Samuel Salt striding over to the wheel Fly ashore Roger and see whether theres a good place to put in Twittering with importance and curiosity the Read Bird flung himself into the air In ten minutes he was back to report a wide river cutting through the center of the island from end to end The foliage was so dense that Roger had not been able to discover any signs of habitation but after viewing the mouth of the river through
