o effect the transformation and preparations for the event were at once made Glinda ordered her own royal couch to be placed in the center of the tent It was piled high with cushions covered with rosecolored silk and from a golden railing above hung many folds of pink gossamer completely concealing the interior of the couch The first act of the Witch was to make the boy drink a potion which quickly sent him into a deep and dreamless sleep Then the Tin Woodman and the WoggleBug bore him gently to the couch placed him upon the soft cushions and drew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all earthly view The Witch squatted upon the ground and kindled a tiny fire of dried herbs which she drew from her bosom When the blaze shot up and burned clearly old Mombi scattered a handful of magical powder over the fire which straightway gave off a rich violet vapor filling all the tent with its fragrance and forcing the SawHorse to sneezealthough he had been warned to keep quiet 274 Full page lineart drawing MOMBI AT HER MAGICAL INCANTATIONS 275 Then while the others watched her curiously the hag chanted a rhythmical verse in words which no one understood and bent her lean body seven times back and forth over the fire And now the incantation seemed complete for the Witch stood upright and cried the one word Yeowa in a loud voice The vapor floated away the atmosphere became clear again a whiff of fresh air filled the tent and the pink curtains of the couch trembled slightly as if stirred from within Glinda walked to the canopy and parted the silken hangings Then she bent over the cushions reached out her hand and from the couch arose the form of a young girl fresh and beautiful as a May morning Her eyes sparkled as two diamonds and her lips were tinted like a tourmaline All adown her back floated tresses of ruddy gold with a slender jeweled circlet confining them at the brow Her robes of silken gauze floated around her like a cloud and dainty satin slippers shod her feet At this exquisite vision Tips old comrades stared in wonder for the space of a full minute and then every head bent low in honest admiration of the lovely Princess Ozma The girl herself cast one look into Glindas bright face which glowed with pleasure and satisfaction and then turned upon the 276 others Speaking the words with sweet diffidence she said I hope none of you will care less for me than you did before Im just the same Tip you know onlyonly Only youre different said the Pumpkinhead and everyone thought it was the wisest speech he had ever made LineArt Drawing 277 Full page lineart drawing 278 The Riches of Content When the wonderful tidings reached the ears of Queen Jinjurhow Mombi the Witch had been captured how she had confessed her crime to Glinda and how the longlost Princess Ozma had been discovered in no less a personage than the boy Tipshe wept real tears of grief and despair To think she moaned that after having ruled as Queen and lived in a palace I must go back to scrubbing floors and churning butter again It is too horrible to think of I will never consent So when her soldiers who spent most of their time making fudge in the palace kitchens counseled Jinjur to resist she listened to their foolish prattle and sent a sharp defiance to Glinda the Good and the Princess Ozma The result was a declaration of war and the very next day Glinda marched upon the Emerald City with pennants flying and bands playing 279 and a forest of shining spears sparkling brightly beneath the suns rays But when it came to the walls this brave assembly made a sudden halt for Jinjur had closed and barred every gateway and the walls of the Emerald City were builded high and thick with many blocks of green marble Finding her advance thus baffled Glinda bent her brows in deep thought while the WoggleBug said in his most positive tone We must lay siege to the city and starve it into submission It is the only thing we can do Not so answered the Scarecrow We still have the Gump and the Gump can still fly The Sorceress turned quickly at this speech and her face now wore a bright smile You are right she exclaimed and certainly have reason to be proud of your brains Let us go to the Gump at once So they passed through the ranks of the army until they came to the place near the Scarecrows tent where the Gump lay Glinda and Princess Ozma mounted first and sat upon the sofas Then the Scarecrow and his friends climbed aboard and still there was room for a Captain and three soldiers which Glinda considered sufficient for a guard Now at a word from the Princess the queer 280 LineArt Drawing Thing they had called the Gump flopped its palmleaf wings and rose into the air carrying the party of adventurers high above the walls They hovered over the palace and soon perceived Jinjur reclining in a hammock in the courtyard where she was comfortably reading a novel with a green cover and eating green chocolates confident that the walls would protect her from her enemies Obeying a quic
