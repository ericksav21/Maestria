rst he did not stop for further talk but made the best speed possible resolved to rush through Gapers Gulch when he came to it without even pausing to express his contempt The pebble awakeners were so neatly timed each guard had a chance to speed an arrow after the flying elephant and by the time Kabumpo reached the opening at the other end of the rocky pass he had forty arrows pricking through his robe or stuck here and there in his ears and ankles With his tough hide they hurt no more than pin pricks but vastly indignant at such treatment the Elegant Elephant began jerking them out with his trunk What do they think I am a pincushion Hoh he snorted pulling out the last one and relieved to note that Randy had escaped the missiles entirely Indeed the young King of Regalia was sleeping as placidly as if he were home in his own castle Kabumpo too felt unaccountably drowsy and as he pushed his way down into the rocky little glen his steps grew slower and slower So far as he could see by the light of the fastwaning moon there were neither houses nor people in Gapers Gulch In the center of the valley the rough stones and brush had been cleared away and a series of flat rocks were spaced out almost like a gigantic checkerboard Pausing beside the largest rock Kabumpo spelled out the name of Sleeperoo the Great and Snorious What is this a cemetery gulped the Elegant Elephant But that could not be for no one in Oz ever dies Ho Hum Leaning up against a dead pine and blinking furiously to keep awake he pondered the unpleasant situation Then deciding that cemetery or not he must have some sleep he lifted Randy down from his back and rolled him in a blanket he had thoughtfully brought along Then divesting himself of his jeweled robe and headpiece Kabumpo stretched out carefully beside his young comrade and in twenty minutes was fast asleep How long he slumbered Kabumpo never knew but from a nightmare in which he was struggling in a bank of treacherous quicksand he awoke with a frightful sinking feeling to find he was surrounded by forty more of the Gaper Guards Their buttons were also lit up and on each plump chest he could read the word Wake The Wakes were busily at work with pick and spade and unlike the Winks did not seem the least bit drowsy Half convinced he was still asleep and dreaming Kabumpo peered out at them through halfclosed lids then gave a tremendous grunt Great Gillikens He was sinking The busy little Wakes had dug a trench at least twenty feet deep all around him and now careless of their own safety were shoveling away at the mound on which he was still precariously resting Quick a few more to the right directed a crisp little voice Watch yourself there Torpy Ah here he comes Heads up lads As the chief Wake spoke Kabumpo felt the mound give way and down he rolled into the pit while the Wakes scrambled frantically up the sides Did you hear that fierce TOOT puffed the little Guard addressed as Torpy Its awake fellows Whats wrong with those sleeping arrows dont they work anymore I myself saw forty sticking in the big Whatisit when he came pounding out of the pass Hurry hurry Lets get him underground And seizing their picks and spades again the Gaper Guards began shoveling dirt into the pit paying no attention to Kabumpos furious blasts and bellows which grew wilder and more anguished as he suddenly realized that Randy was no longer beside him What have you done with the boy Halt Stop How dare you cast dirt on an Imperial Prince of Pumperdink or try to bury the Elegant Elephant of Oz Shaking the mud from his head and raising his trunk Kabumpo let out such an earsplitting trumpet twenty Wakes fell to their knees and the others dropped pick and shovel and stared at him in positive dismay But sir it is quite customary to bury all visitors quavered Torpy as soon as he could make himself heard Well dig you up in six months and youll be good as new Our dormitories are so very comfortable and all Gapers lie dormant for six months But Im not a GAPER screamed Kabumpo interrupting himself with a yawn both wide and gusty Oh but you soon will be asserted Torpy squinting down at him earnestly Why youre gaping already Now lie down like a good beast Sleeping underground is lovely LOVELY repeated all the rest of the Wakes beginning to croon as they shoveled Kabumpo opening his mouth to protest again caught a bushel of earth between his tusks and half choked and blind with rage the Elegant Elephant hurled himself at the side of the pit He could almost reach the top with his trunk and as the Wakes squealing with alarm shoveled faster and faster he wound his trunk round an old tree stump and by main strength hauled himself up over the edge NOW he bellowed spreading his ears like sails Where have you buried the boy Quick speak up or Ill pound you to splinters Snatching a log in his trunk Kabumpo surged forward But the terrified Wakes instead of answering fled for their lives leaving Kabumpo all alone in the ghostly little valle
