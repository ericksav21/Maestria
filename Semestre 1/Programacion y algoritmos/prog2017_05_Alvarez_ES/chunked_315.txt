might not need to take any advice at all added Roger with a long and knowing wink But I like you to tell me things said Tandy looking earnestly up at the Read Bird You make everything seem so interesting and jolly With a secret smile for Tandy was thinking how much he would enjoy taking a poke at Didjabo the Chief Ozamandarin the little boy went on with his polishing If Didjabo said anything further about shutting him up in the Tower he just plain would take a poke at him But saying nothing of all this to Roger he called up cheerfully Hows Mofi Has he stopped scolding and begun to eat Roger who was running races with himself up and down the taffrail stopped short and held up his claw Everything I give him he told Tandy solemnly And I declare to badness hes getting to know me Mate He only pulled out three feathers instead of a fistful when I gave him breakfast just now Before long hell be so tame hell be riding around on your shoulder Not MY shoulder laughed Tandy waving his bottle of polish at the Read Bird Goodness I believe youre growing fond of that monkey fish Roger Well why not retorted the Read Bird puffing up his chest Ato has me the Captain has Sally you have Kobo so why shouldnt I have a little pet if I want one The monkey fish seemed such a strange prickly sort of pet that Tandy could hardly keep his face straight but seeing Roger was quite in earnest he tactfully changed the subject Do you suppose well make any new discoveries today he asked screwing the cap on the bottle of polish Any as important as the sea forest I mean Why not call it by its proper name teased Roger scratching his head with his left claw And I think it most unlikely well strike anything as curious and important as Tazander Forest Two discoveries like that just couldnt happen two days running Still Ill just fly up to the main truck and have a look around Main truck Tandy wrinkled up his brows I thought I knew all the parts of this ship by now You never told me about the main truck Roger Just the top of the main mast Brainless Giving Tandy an affectionate little shove Roger soared into the rigging and Tandy went joyfully off to have another look at the forest Samuel had insisted on naming after him He had taken great pains with the painting and printing when he sketched it on the map and now with a sigh of complete satisfaction he stood regarding the sea chart Then suddenly remembering he had promised to water Samuel Salts plants he jogtrotted contentedly down to the hold The tumbleweeds in their small red pots grew so rapidly Samuel had to cut them back every day These Tandy watered very sparingly snapping his fingers at Mofi who was gravely chinning himself on a branch of his artificial tree The slips of the sea trees in their covered aquarium required no attention at all Ato had planted all the vegetable and fruit vines from Peakenspire on the rail outside the galley so that left only the creeping vines from Patrippany Island to care for He had just picked up one of the small potted creepers when a sharp rap tap under his toes made Tandy leap straight up in the air Someone was knocking on the bottom of the boat Ato Captain ROGER shrilled the little boy scurrying up from the hold faster than he had ever done before SusuSOMEBODYS knocking on the bottom of the boat Before he could explain or tell them anything further a perfectly terrific knock from below made the Crescent Moon shiver from end to end Samuel and Ato leaning over the port rail turned round so suddenly they bumped their heads smartly together Next with a scrape screech and splintering of timber a giant white horn came tearing up through the decks Whale Whale croaked Roger falling off the main truck and coasting crazily down to the deck Whawhat ever n evers that he quavered pointing a trembling claw at the rigid white column between the main and mizzen masts Samuel did not even try to explain for at that instant the ship began to rise to fall to lash and plunge both up and down and east and west Hooking his arms through the rail Tandy blinked gasped and shudderingly waited for the Crescent Moon to fly asunder Narwhal Mates panted Samuel Salt throwing himself bodily upon the wheel Horn like aC4unicornC4branch of the Odontocetes andFF20C4 Oh C4 you C4 dont C4 say C4 it C4 is chattered Ato who was lying on his stomach bouncing up and down like a ball at each frightful lunge of the monstrous fish Well its spiked us Is that a horn or a ships mast Oh woe oh Whatn saltll we do now Samuel had not the heart to answer for he had all he could do to hang on to the wheel as the ship like a wounded animal reared and plunged thrashing the sea to a fury of foam and spray Nikobo diving precipitously off her raft began to squeal in high and low hippopotamy making brave but ineffective lunges at the lashing giant beneath the ship Susuppose it susubmerges wailed Ato who had managed at last to seize a rope from the end of which he banged and slammed continuously up and down against the
