 city and back to their tents The Scarecrow and his comrades happened to be 255 searching in the garden of the palace just then and they turned with disappointment to obey Glindas command But before they left the garden the Tin Woodman who was fond of flowers chanced to espy a big red rose growing upon a bush so he plucked the flower and fastened it securely in the tin buttonhole of his tin bosom As he did this he fancied he heard a low moan proceed from the rose but he paid no attention to the sound and Mombi was thus carried out of the city and into Glindas camp without anyone having a suspicion that they had succeeded in their quest LineArt Drawing 256 The Transformation of Old Mombi The Witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the enemy but soon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the Tin Woodmans buttonhole as growing upon the bush For no one knew the rose and Mombi to be one and now that she was without the gates of the City her chances of escaping altogether from Glinda were much improved But there is no hurry thought Mombi I will wait awhile and enjoy the humiliation of this Sorceress when she finds I have outwitted her So throughout the night the rose lay quietly on the Woodmans bosom and in the morning when Glinda summoned our friends to a consultation Nick Chopper carried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent 257 LineArt Drawing For some reason said Glinda we have failed to find this cunning old Mombi so I fear our expedition will prove a failure And for that I am sorry because without our assistance little Ozma will never be rescued and restored to her rightful position as Queen of the Emerald City Do not let us give up so easily said the Pumpkinhead Let us do something else Something else must really be done replied Glinda with a smile yet I cannot understand how I have been defeated so easily by an old Witch who knows far less of magic than I do myself While we are on the ground I believe it would be wise for us to conquer the Emerald City for Princess Ozma and find the girl afterward said the Scarecrow And while the girl remains hidden I will gladly rule in her place for I understand the business of ruling much better than Jinjur does 258 But I have promised not to molest Jinjur objected Glinda Suppose you all return with me to my kingdomor Empire rather said the Tin Woodman politely including the entire party in a royal wave of his arm It will give me great pleasure to entertain you in my castle where there is room enough and to spare And if any of you wish to be nickel plated my valet will do it free of all expense While the Woodman was speaking Glindas eyes had been noting the rose in his buttonhole and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of the flower tremble slightly This quickly aroused her suspicions and in a moment more the Sorceress had decided that the seeming rose was nothing else than a transformation of old Mombi At the same instant Mombi knew she was discovered and must quickly plan an escape and as transformations were easy to her she immediately took the form of a Shadow and glided along the wall of the tent toward the entrance thinking thus to disappear But Glinda had not only equal cunning but far more experience than the Witch So the Sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the Shadow and with a wave of her hand closed the entrance so securely that Mombi could not find a crack big 259 enough to creep through The Scarecrow and his friends were greatly surprised at Glindas actions for none of them had noted the Shadow But the Sorceress said to them Remain perfectly quiet all of you For the old Witch is even now with us in this tent and I hope to capture her These words so alarmed Mombi that she quickly transformed herself from a shadow to a Black Ant in which shape she crawled along the ground seeking a crack or crevice in which to hide her tiny body Fortunately the ground where the tent had been pitched being Just before the city gates was hard and smooth and while the Ant still crawled about Glinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture But Just as her hand was descending the Witch now fairly frantic with fear made her last transformation and in the form of a huge Griffin sprang through the wall of the tenttearing the silk asunder in her rushand in a moment had darted away with the speed of a whirlwind Glinda did not hesitate to follow She sprang upon the back of the SawHorse and cried Now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive Runrunrun The SawHorse ran Like a flash he followed the 260 Griffin his wooden legs moving so fast that they twinkled like the rays of a star Before our friends could recover from their surprise both the Griffin and the SawHorse had dashed out of sight Come Let us follow cried the Scarecrow They ran to the place where the Gump was lying and quickly tumbled aboard Fly commanded Tip eagerly Where to asked the Gump in its calm voice I dont know returned Tip who was v
