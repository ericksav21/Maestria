orothy and I am glad I was of use to these good friends But now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides I think I should like to go back to Kansas The Silver Shoes said the Good Witch have wonderful powers And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go If that is so said the child joyfully I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once She threw her arms around the Lions neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly Then she kissed the Tin Woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints But she hugged the soft stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a goodbye kiss and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last goodbye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times saying Take me home to Aunt Em Instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears The Silver Shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was At length however she sat up and looked about her Good gracious she cried For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking furiously Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stockingfeet For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert 24 Home Again Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her My darling child she cried folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses Where in the world did you come from From the Land of Oz said Dorothy gravely And here is Toto too And oh Aunt Em Im so glad to be at home again End of Project Gutenbergs The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ This file should be named 55txt or 55zip This and all associated files of various formats will be found in httpwwwgutenbergorg555 Updated editions will replace the previous onethe old editions will be renamed Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works so the Foundation and you can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties Special rules set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenbergtm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERGtm concept and trademark Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks unless you receive specific permission If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook complying with the rules is very easy You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works reports performances and research They may be modified and printed and given awayyou may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks Redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution START FULL LICENSE THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK To protect the Project Gutenbergtm mission of promoting the free distribution of electronic works by using or distributing this work or any other work associated in any way with the phrase Project Gutenberg you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenbergtm License available with this file or online at httpgutenbergnetlicense Section 1 General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenbergtm electronic works 1A By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenbergtm electronic work you indicate that you have read understand agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property trademarkcopyright agreement If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenbergtm electronic works in your possession If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenbergtm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid
