 the fact that the world cannot produce another WoggleBug with a tenth part of my own culture and erudition I do not blame you said the Scarecrow Education is a thing to be proud of Im educated myself The mess of brains given me by the Great 149 Wizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled Nevertheless interrupted the Tin Woodman a good heart is I believe much more desirable than education or brains To me said the SawHorse a good leg is more desirable than either Could seeds be considered in the light of brains enquired the Pumpkinhead abruptly Keep quiet commanded Tip sternly Very well dear father answered the obedient Jack The WoggleBug listened patientlyeven respectfullyto these remarks and then resumed his story I must have lived fully three years in that secluded schoolhouse hearth said he drinking thirstily of the everflowing fount of limpid knowledge before me Quite poetical commented the Scarecrow nodding his head approvingly But one day continued the Bug a marvelous circumstance occurred that altered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle of greatness The LineArt Drawing 150 Professor discovered me in the act of crawling across the hearth and before I could escape he had caught me between his thumb and forefinger My dear children said he I have captured a WoggleBuga very rare and interesting specimen Do any of you know what a WoggleBug is No yelled the scholars in chorus Then said the Professor I will get out my famous magnifyingglass and throw the insect upon a screen in a highlymagnified condition that you may all study carefully its peculiar construction and become acquainted with its habits and manner of life He then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument and before I could realize what had happened I found myself thrown upon a screen in a highlymagnified stateeven as you now behold me The students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward to get a better view of me and two little girls jumped upon the sill of an open window where they could see more plainly Behold cried the Professor in a loud voice this highlymagnified WoggleBug one of the most curious insects in existence Being Thoroughly Educated and knowing what is required of a cultured gentleman at this juncture I stood upright and placing my hand upon my 151 Full page lineart drawing THEE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS 152 bosom made a very polite bow My action being unexpected must have startled them for one of the little girls perched upon the windowsill gave a scream and fell backward out the window drawing her companion with her as she disappeared The Professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door to see if the poor children were injured by the fall The scholars followed after him in a wild mob and I was left alone in the schoolroom still in a HighlyMagnified state and free to do as I pleased It immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to escape I was proud of my great size and realized that now I could safely travel anywhere in the world while my superior culture would make me a fit associate for the most learned person I might chance to meet So while the Professor picked the little girlswho were more frightened than hurtoff the ground and the pupils clustered around him closely grouped I calmly walked out of the schoolhouse turned a corner and escaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near Wonderful exclaimed the Pumpkinhead admiringly It was indeed agreed the WoggleBug I 153 have never ceased to congratulate myself for escaping while I was Highly Magnified for even my excess LineArt Drawing ive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had I remained a tiny insignificant insect I didnt know before said Tip looking at the 154 WoggleBug with a puzzled expression that insects wore clothes Nor do they in their natural state returned the stranger But in the course of my wanderings I had the good fortune to save the ninth life of a tailortailors having like cats nine lives as you probably know The fellow was exceedingly grateful for had he lost that ninth life it would have been the end of him so he begged permission to furnish me with the stylish costume I now wear It fits very nicely does it not and the WoggleBug stood up and turned himself around slowly that all might examine his person He must have been a good tailor said the Scarecrow somewhat enviously He was a goodhearted tailor at any rate observed Nick Chopper But where were you going when you met us Tip asked the WoggleBug Nowhere in particular was the reply although it is my intention soon to visit the Emerald City and arrange to give a course of lectures to select audiences on the Advantages of Magnification We are bound for the Emerald City now said the Tin Woodman so if it pleases you to do so you are welcome to travel in our company 155 The WoggleBug bowed with profound grace It will give me great pleasure said he to accept your kind invitation for nowhere in the Land
