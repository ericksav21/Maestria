 City and they can go no further than that Meantime Jack was holding fast to the post and the SawHorse was tearing along the road like a racer Neither of them knew Tip was left behind for the Pumpkinhead did not look around and the SawHorse couldnt As he rode Jack noticed that the grass and trees 65 had become a bright emeraldgreen in color so he guessed they were nearing the Emerald City even before the tall spires and domes came into sight At length a high wall of green stone studded thick with emeralds loomed up before them and fearing the SawHorse would not know enough to stop and so might smash them both against this wall Jack ventured to cry Whoa as loud as he could So suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post Jack would have been pitched off head foremost and his beautiful face ruined That was a fast ride dear father he exclaimed and then hearing no reply he turned around and discovered for the first time that Tip was not there This apparent desertion puzzled the Pumpkinhead and made him uneasy And while he was wondering what had become of the boy and what he ought to do next under such trying circumstances the gateway in the green wall opened and a man came out This man was short and round with a fat face that seemed remarkably good natured He was clothed all in green and wore a high peaked green hat upon his head and green spectacles over his eyes Bowing before the Pumpkinhead he said I am the Guardian of the Gates of the Emerald 66 City May I inquire who you are and what is your business My name is Jack Pumpkinhead returned the other smilingly but as to my business I havent the least idea in the world what it is The Guardian of the Gates looked surprised and shook his head as if dissatisfied with the reply What are you a man or a pumpkin he asked politely Both if you please answered Jack And this wooden horseis it alive questioned the Guardian The horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at Jack Then it gave a prance and brought one leg down on the Guardians toes Ouch cried the man Im sorry I asked that question But the answer is most convincing Have you any errand sir in the Emerald City It seems to me that I have replied the Pumpkinhead seriously but I cannot think what it is My father knows all about it but he is not here This is a strange affair very strange declared the Guardian But you seem harmless Folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean mischief As for that said Jack I cannot help my smile for it is carved on my face with a jackknife 67 Well come with me into my room resumed the Guardian and I will see what can be done for you So Jack rode the SawHorse through the gateway into a little room built into the wall The Guardian pulled a bellcord and presently a very tall soldierclothed in a green uniformentered from the opposite door This soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green whiskers that fell quite to his knees The Guardian at once addressed him saying Here is a strange gentleman who doesnt know why he has come to the Emerald City or what he wants Tell me what shall we do with him The Soldier with the Green Whiskers looked at Jack with much care and curiosity Finally he shook his head so positively that little waves rippled down his whiskers and then he said I must take him to His Majesty the Scarecrow But what will His Majesty the Scarecrow do with him asked the Guardian of the Gates That is His Majestys business returned the soldier I have troubles enough of my own All outside troubles must be turned over to His Majesty So put the spectacles on this fellow and Ill take him to the royal palace 68 So the Guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair to Jacks great round eyes I havent a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes up said the little man with a sigh and your head is so big that I shall be obliged to tie the spectacles on But why need I wear spectacles asked Jack Its the fashion here said the Soldier and they will keep you from being blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous Emerald City Oh exclaimed Jack Tie them on by all means I dont wish to be blinded Nor I broke in the SawHorse so a pair of green spectacles was quickly fastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes Then the Soldier with the Green Whiskers led them through the inner gate and they at once found themselves in the main street of the magnificent Emerald City Sparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and the towers and turrets were all faced with emeralds Even the green marble pavement glittered with precious stones and it was indeed a grand and marvelous sight to one who beheld it for the first time However the Pumpkinhead and the SawHorse 69 knowing nothing of wealth and beauty paid little attention to the wonderful sights they saw through their green spectacles They calmly followed after the green soldier and scarcely noticed the crowds of green people who stared at them in surpris
