under the hatches with em cried Roger beside himself with joy and exuberance at the neat way Ato had handled Tandys subjects This boys an ablebodied seaman and explorer and will stand no nonsense My sea is the desert said Chunum striding jauntily along beside Nikobo and my ship is a camel but Ill wager well understand each other well enough for all that To Tandy conversing eagerly with Chunum the splendor of the White city of Om was an old story but to the others it seemed with its flashing marble walks great waving palms and towering dwellings and castle one of the loveliest capitals they had yet visited Word of the happenings on the cliff had traveled fast Longing to welcome the young King but fearing the strange magicians who had come with him the Nobles had barred themselves in their fine houses and the natives had fled to the hills beyond the city gates The manydomed marble palace was absolutely deserted when Nikobo pushed her way through the wide doors Not a footman page or courtier was in sight Seeing no attention or service was to be had for some time Ato hurried away to the kitchen and was soon happily at work preparing a splendid feast to celebrate Tandys homecoming 20 Tandy himself felt quiet and sad examining with scant interest and enthusiasm the splendid rooms which he had never yet been allowed to live in To tell the truth he would have traded the whole castle for his small cabin aboard Samuels ship Samuel himself never really happy or comfortable ashore wandered about aimlessly opening books on the long tables peering out windows and finally settling with a sigh of resignation in a huge chair beside the throne Nikobo had found a long pool and fountain in the same room and lying at full length in this luxuriant marble bath tranquilly waited for events to shape themselves Why not sit on your throne asked Roger as Tandy seated himself on a small stool beside Samuel Salt Oh its much too big for me sighed Tandy thinking how very big and lonely the palace would seem when all his shipmates had gone Aho and methinks you are right Ahoy the beginning of a beautiful idea doth at this moment start to seep through the head feathers Of which more anon Chunum who had never before heard a bird talk stared at Roger in amazed interest and surprise but giving him no more satisfaction than a mischievous wink the Read Bird flew off to help Ato with the dinner And now Samuel proceeded to tell the old tribesman how he had found Tandy in the jungle imprisoned in the wooden cage As he finished Chunum shook his head in stern displeasure It has long been my conviction and belief he stated solemnly that the Ozamandarins are at the bottom of this Every year they usurp more and more power and keeping the young King shut up in the Tower was but an excuse to give them their own will and way Nor can I believe that the royal parents of this boy accidentally fell into the sea as they were reported to have done or that the young aunts mentioned in the prophecy had anything at all to do with Tandys abduction Tell me how long will the vines hold those villains prisoner for only that long is Tazander safe We must think and act quickly said Chunum tapping his staff thoughtfully on the floor The vines will not unwind for two days and before THEN C4 HAH Samuel expelled his breath in a mighty blast and sprang purposefully to his feet Before then we shall put those fellows in a very safe place for Tandy and for them too shiver my timbers Taking Chunum by the shoulder Samuel started toward the door and seeing the two intended to leave the castle Nikobo climbed out of the fountain and offered to carry them Tandy nodded absently as the two left the castle his thoughts still far away on the Crescent Moon and considering the work they had to do Samuel and Chunum were well pleased to leave him behind With surprising speed the hippopotamus made the return trip to the cliffs The effects of the tumbleweed had evidently worn off and the guards and their mounts had fled with the rest of the inhabitants of White City to the hills But the nine Ozamandarins still lay in their curious cradles in the deep coarse sand As Samuel and Chunum in absolute agreement as to what should be done rolled off Nikobos back a furious bellow and screech brought them up short Nikobo startled out of her usual calm fell back on her haunches and after one horrified look upward buried her head in the sand It cant be cried Samuel clutching Chunums sleeve It cant be but it is An elephant a flying elephant panted Chunum dragging Samuel from under the immense shadow Flatten yourself in the sand seaman and we may yet be spared As Samuel more amazed than scared at so strange and curious a specimen and even vaguely hopeful of capturing the unwieldy creature made no move Chunum dragged him down by main force The elephant meanwhile lighted like some gigantic butterfly on the edge of the cliff Fairly bleating with fright and terror the nine Ozamandarins watched him swooping toward
