Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and there they rusted When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong But the Scarecrow seized the oilcan from Dorothys basket and oiled the Woodmans jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before This will serve me a lesson said he to look where I step For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak Thereafter he walked very carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything You people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but I have no heart and so I must be very careful When Oz gives me a heart of course I neednt mind so much 7 The Journey to the Great Oz They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for there were no houses near The tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely She and Toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast If you wish said the Lion I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you You can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and then you will have a very good breakfast Dont Please dont begged the Tin Woodman I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didnt mention it And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothys basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up So he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep These kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning When it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City This was to be an eventful day for the travelers They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side It was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end What shall we do asked Dorothy despairingly I havent the faintest idea said the Tin Woodman and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful But the Scarecrow said We cannot fly that is certain Neither can we climb down into this great ditch Therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are I think I could jump over it said the Cowardly Lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind Then we are all right answered the Scarecrow for you can carry us all over on your back one at a time Well Ill try it said the Lion Who will go first I will declared the Scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf Dorothy would be killed or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below But if I am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all I am terribly afraid of falling myself said the Cowardly Lion but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it So get on my back and we will make the attempt The Scarecrow sat upon the Lions back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down Why dont you run and jump asked the Scarecrow Because that isnt the way we Lions do these things he replied Then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side They were all greatly pleas
