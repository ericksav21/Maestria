ys were white some were brown or gray or black or spotted but their hair was sleek and smooth and their broad collars and caps gave them a neat if whimsical appearance This is a nice way to welcome visitors I must say remarked the shaggy man in a reproachful tone Oh we did not mean to be impolite replied a grey donkey which had not spoken before But you were not expected nor did you send in your visiting cards as it is proper to do There is some truth in that admitted the shaggy man but now you are informed that we are important and distinguished travelers I trust you will accord us proper consideration These big words delighted the donkeys and made them bow to the shaggy man with great respect Said the grey one You shall be taken before his great and glorious Majesty King Kikabray who will greet you as becomes your exalted stations Thats right answered Dorothy Take us to some one who knows something Oh we all know something my child or we shouldnt be donkeys asserted the grey one with dignity The word donkey means clever you know I didnt know it she replied I thought it meant stupid Not at all my child If you will look in the Encyclopedia Donkaniara you will find Im correct But come I will myself lead you before our splendid exalted and most intellectual ruler All donkeys love big words so it is no wonder the grey one used so many of them 7 The Shaggy Mans Transformation They found the houses of the town all low and square and built of bricks neatly whitewashed inside and out The houses were not set in rows forming regular streets but placed here and there in a haphazard manner which made it puzzling for a stranger to find his way Stupid people must have streets and numbered houses in their cities to guide them where to go observed the grey donkey as he walked before the visitors on his hind legs in an awkward but comical manner but clever donkeys know their way about without such absurd marks Moreover a mixed city is much prettier than one with straight streets Dorothy did not agree with this but she said nothing to contradict it Presently she saw a sign on a house that read Madam de Fayke Hoofist and she asked their conductor Whats a hoofist please One who reads your fortune in your hoofs replied the grey donkey Oh I see said the little girl You are quite civilized here Dunkiton he replied is the center of the worlds highest civilization They came to a house where two youthful donkeys were whitewashing the wall and Dorothy stopped a moment to watch them They dipped the ends of their tails which were much like paintbrushes into a pail of whitewash backed up against the house and wagged their tails right and left until the whitewash was rubbed on the wall after which they dipped these funny brushes in the pail again and repeated the performance That must be fun said ButtonBright No its work replied the old donkey but we make our youngsters do all the whitewashing to keep them out of mischief Dont they go to school asked Dorothy All donkeys are born wise was the reply so the only school we need is the school of experience Books are only for those who know nothing and so are obliged to learn things from other people In other words the more stupid one is the more he thinks he knows observed the shaggy man The grey donkey paid no attention to this speech because he had just stopped before a house which had painted over the doorway a pair of hoofs with a donkey tail between them and a rude crown and sceptre above Ill see if his magnificent Majesty King Kikabray is at home said he He lifted his head and called Wheehaw wheehaw wheehaw three times in a shocking voice turning about and kicking with his heels against the panel of the door For a time there was no reply then the door opened far enough to permit a donkeys head to stick out and look at them It was a white head with big awful ears and round solemn eyes Have the foxes gone it asked in a trembling voice They havent been here most stupendous Majesty replied the grey one The new arrivals prove to be travelers of distinction Oh said the King in a relieved tone of voice Let them come in He opened the door wide and the party marched into a big room which Dorothy thought looked quite unlike a kings palace There were mats of woven grasses on the floor and the place was clean and neat but his Majesty had no other furniture at allperhaps because he didnt need it He squatted down in the center of the room and a little brown donkey ran and brought a big gold crown which it placed on the monarchs head and a golden staff with a jeweled ball at the end of it which the King held between his front hoofs as he sat upright Now then said his Majesty waving his long ears gently to and fro tell me why you are here and what you expect me to do for you He eyed ButtonBright rather sharply as if afraid of the little boys queer head though it was the shaggy man who undertook to reply Most noble and supreme ruler of Dunkiton he said trying not to laugh in the solemn Kings face we ar
