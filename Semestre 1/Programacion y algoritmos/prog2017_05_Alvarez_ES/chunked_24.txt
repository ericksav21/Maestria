 with Toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly but he saw the mark of the Good Witchs kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her We dare not harm this little girl he said to them for she is protected by the Power of Good and that is greater than the Power of Evil All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there So carefully and gently they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front doorstep Then the leader said to the Witch We have obeyed you as far as we were able The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed and the Lion is tied up in your yard The little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms Your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again Then all the Winged Monkeys with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on Dorothys forehead for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way She looked down at Dorothys feet and seeing the Silver Shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy but she happened to look into the childs eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself and thought I can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power Then she said to Dorothy harshly and severely Come with me and see that you mind everything I tell you for if you do not I will make an end of you as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood Dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her With Dorothy hard at work the Witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid and ran out and shut the gate again If I cannot harness you said the Witch to the Lion speaking through the bars of the gate I can starve you You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse And the Lion would answer No If you come in this yard I will bite you The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape But they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them The girl had to work hard during the day and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand But in truth she did not dare to strike Dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead The child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and Toto Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before Dorothys life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she ha
