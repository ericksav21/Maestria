 to old Mombi and limped slightly on his left foot Ah that last is certainly suspicious exclaimed the Pumpkinhead Not necessarily said the Scarecrow he may have had corns Now it seems to me his eating beans with a knife is more suspicious Perhaps it is a polite custom in Omaha from which great country the Wizard originally came suggested the Tin Woodman It may be admitted the Scarecrow 244 But why asked Glinda did he make three secret visits to old Mombi Ah Why indeed echoed the WoggleBug impressively We know that the Wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of magic continued Glinda and this he would not have done had she not assisted him in some way So we may suspect with good reason that Mombi aided him to hide the girl Ozma who was the real heir to the throne of the Emerald City and a constant danger to the usurper For if the people knew that she lived they would quickly make her their Queen and restore her to her rightful position An able argument cried the Scarecrow I have no doubt that Mombi was mixed up in this wicked business But how does that knowledge help us We must find Mombi replied Glinda and force her to tell where the girl is hidden Mombi is now with Queen Jinjur in the Emerald City said Tip It was she who threw so many obstacles in our pathway and made Jinjur threaten to destroy my friends and give me back into the old witchs power Then decided Glinda I will march with my 245 army to the Emerald City and take Mombi prisoner After that we can perhaps force her to tell the truth about Ozma She is a terrible old woman remarked Tip with a shudder at the thought of Mombis black kettle and obstinate too I am quite obstinate myself returned the Sorceress with a sweet smile so I do not fear Mombi in the least Today I will make all necessary preparations and we will march upon the Emerald City at daybreak tomorrow LineArt Drawing 246 The TinWoodman Plucks a Rose The Army of Glinda the Good looked very grand and imposing when it assembled at daybreak before the palace gates The uniforms of the girl soldiers were pretty and of gay colors and their silvertipped spears were bright and glistening the long shafts being inlaid with motherofpearl All the officers wore sharp gleaming swords and shields edged with peacockfeathers and it really seemed that no foe could by any possibility defeat such a brilliant army The Sorceress rode in a beautiful palanquin which was like the body of a coach having doors and 247 windows with silken curtains but instead of wheels which a coach has the palanquin rested upon two long horizontal bars which were borne upon the shoulders of twelve servants The Scarecrow and his comrades decided to ride in the Gump in order to keep up with the swift march of the army so as soon as Glinda had started and her soldiers had marched away to the inspiring strains of music played by the royal band our friends climbed into the sofas and followed The Gump flew along slowly at a point directly over the palanquin in which rode the Sorceress Be careful said the LineArt Drawing 248 Tin Woodman to the Scarecrow who was leaning far over the side to look at the army below You might fall It wouldnt matter remarked the educated WoggleBug he cant get broke so long as he is stuffed with money Didnt I ask you began Tip in a reproachful voice You did said the WoggleBug promptly And I beg your pardon I will really try to restrain myself Youd better declared the boy That is if you wish to travel in our company Ah I couldnt bear to part with you now murmured the Insect feelingly so Tip let the subject drop The army moved steadily on but night had fallen before they came to the walls of the Emerald City By the dim light of the new moon however Glindas forces silently surrounded the city and pitched their tents of scarlet silk upon the greensward The tent of the Sorceress was larger than the others and was composed of pure white silk with scarlet banners flying above it A tent was also pitched for the Scarecrows party and when these preparations had been made with military precision and quickness the army retired to rest 249 Great was the amazement of Queen Jinjur next morning when her soldiers came running to inform her of the vast army surrounding them She at once climbed to a high tower of the royal palace and saw banners waving in every direction and the great white tent of Glinda standing directly before the gates We are surely lost cried Jinjur in despair for how can our knittingneedles avail against the long spears and terrible swords of our foes The best thing we can do said one of the girls is to surrender as quickly as possible before we get hurt Not so returned Jinjur more bravely The enemy is still outside the walls so we must try to gain time by engaging them in parley Go you with a flag of truce to Glinda and ask her why she has dared to invade my dominions and what are her demands So the girl passed through the gates bearing a white flag to show she was on a mission of peace and came to
