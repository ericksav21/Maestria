eagues long and yards through the head was large as a whole elephant with a long curling silver tongue and darting green fangs But it was the teeth that made even the stout heart of Ato hammer against his ribs Each tooth of this singular sea serpent was a live white goblin brandishing a long spear Leaning far out of the yawning mouth they screamed hissed and yelled at the defenseless company below The next forward thrust of the monster brought its head curling right down among them This so startled Tandy he could neither move nor scream Samuel fired his blunderbuss so fast and furiously it sounded like a dozen guns but it was Ato who really saved the day and his shipmates With calm and deadly precision the ships cook flung the pan of still bubbling molasses straight into the cavernous mouth Screaming with surprise pain and fury the monster clamped its jaws together and finding them stuck fast on the taffy fell writhing back into the sea dashing and slashing its head under water to ease the burn and setting the Crescent Moon to dancing like a cocklebur But the taffy hardened by contact with the cold water stuck faster than ever and unable to bite and scarcely able to breathe the discomfited sea monster backed away from the ship and went slithering and thrashing away toward the skyline Well there goes our candy pull sighed Roger falling in a limp heap to Atos shoulder Nice work Nice work King dear Theres a certain touch about your fighting that is well nigh irresistible Mainsls and topsls You certainly pulled a trick THAT time puffed Samuel Salt picking up his spyglass to have a last look at his lovely specimen You saved us and the ship that time Mate My bullets rattled off its hide like hailstones off a roof Pooh Just happened to have the taffy handy answered Ato looking rather regretfully into the empty pot Here child run back and tell Kobo everythings all right The ships cook pulled Tandy quickly to his feet Just listen to her squealing The poor lass is probably frightened out of her skin As Tandy started aft on a run Ato picked up the sketch he had made of the monster Ahoy and whats this he panted What did I tell you Sammy Look the boys drawn as lively a picture of that varmint as youd ever hope to paste in a scrapbook Here it is tail teeth and everything Mean to say he drew that while we were all standing here ready to perish and go down with the ship Hah Thats what I call bravery in action exclaimed Samuel And goosewing my topsails If the young lubber can draw like this hell be a monstrous help to us Mates Why Ill make him cabin boy and Royal Artist of the Expedition with extra rations and pay Hurray And Ill tell him puffed Roger spreading his wings gleefully Hi King Hi Tandy Ho Tandy Youve been promoted from King to cabin boy and Royal Drawer of Animals and Islands and extry rations and pay Nikobo was as pleased as Tandy at her little charges rise to favor and after they had both listened in rapt silence to Rogers news Tandy told her how Ato had routed the sea serpent Meanwhile Roger had carried all the sketches Tandy had made of the Leopard Men and Patrippany Island to the main cabin Samuels delight and enthusiasm at having such spirited and authentic records of the lost tribe and strange animals on Patrippany Island knew no bounds He beamed on Tandy so kindly and approvingly the next time they met the little boy felt warm and jolly all the way down to his heels Roger had already exclaimed his new duties to him and when Ato sounded the gong for dinner Tandy was20the first to answer But when he started to pass the vegetables and wait on the table the Captain gruffly pushed him into a chair All equals here roared Samuel slapping him affectionately on the shoulder Youve earned your place and your salt sonny and well all help ourselves and each other Tilting back his chair and keeping time with his teacup Samuel began to sing lustily Blow high blow low Tis a sea life for meFF20C4 With a good ships crew Ill sail the blue With a good ship going freeeeeheeeh With a good ship going free Almost before he knew it Tandy was singing too CHAPTER 10 THE CITY OF BRIDGES The days that followed always seemed to Tandy the happiest he had known He wondered how he had ever endured his long tedious pentup life in Ozamaland There was so much to see and do on a ship that the hours were not half long enough Being a fullfledged member of the crew he took his turn on watch his trick at the wheel and had besides other duties on deck After a bit of practice he could scramble aloft like a monkey and liked nothing so much as perching in the rigging looking far out to sea The Read Bird has fastened a special rope to the mizzenmast so that Tandy could swing out and drop down on Nikobos raft and much of his free time was spent with the faithful hippopotamus Sea life agreed enormously with Nikobo especially since Ato had solved the largest item of her diet Noting the tangled mass of seaweed often floating by on the surface of the sea
