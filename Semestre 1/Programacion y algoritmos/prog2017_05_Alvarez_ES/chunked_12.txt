ed to see how easily he did it and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again Dorothy thought she would go next so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lions back holding tightly to his mane with one hand The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long They found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again To add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived What are the Kalidahs asked the girl They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers replied the Lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto Im terribly afraid of the Kalidahs Im not surprised that you are returned Dorothy They must be dreadful beasts The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it So they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the Scarecrow said Here is a great tree standing close to the ditch If the Tin Woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily That is a firstrate idea said the Lion One would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw The Woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers They are the Kalidahs said the Cowardly Lion beginning to tremble Quick cried the Scarecrow Let us cross over So Dorothy went first holding Toto in her arms the Tin Woodman followed and the Scarecrow came next The Lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the Kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise But seeing they were bigger than the Lion and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him the Kalidahs again rushed forward and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree And the Lion said to Dorothy We are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws But stand close behind me and I will fight them as long as I am alive Wait a minute called the Scarecrow He had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch The Tin Woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom Well said the Cowardly Lion drawing a long breath of relief I see we are going to live a little while longer and I am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet Ah said the Tin Woodman sadly I wish I had a heart to beat This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired and had to ride on the Lions back To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them How shall we cross the river asked Dorothy That is easily done replied the Scarecrow The Tin Woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft and while he was busy at this the S
