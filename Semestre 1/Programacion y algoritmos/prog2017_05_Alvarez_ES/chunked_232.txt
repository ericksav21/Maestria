dered too pleasant and friendly to conquer Besides the climate of Ix was not much better than that of his own country To the west of Skampavia was Merryland and at one time a band of his roistering Skampavians had crossed over into that country bent on theft and mischief Recalling the way they had been welcomed and entertained by the cheerful King of Merryland and sent home simply laden with presents he hastily dismissed that country too How could he fight a monarch like that To the south lay the burning sands of the Deadly Desert which no man in his own Kingdom had ever succeeded in crossing So having exhausted all the possibilities in the immediate neighborhood Skamperoo tapped his foot in vexation and began casting about in his mind for some fair and faraway country to conquer He closed his eyes in order to think better and was just on the point of falling into a pleasant doze of riches and conquest when Pinny Penny came noisily into the room He was preceded by two of the Kings Supervisors who urged forward by the fearless little Prime Minister stood sulkily and defiantly before the throne Well what now demanded Skamperoo blinking his eyes sleepily Can you not handle these arguments yourself Pinny Penny Is a King to have no rest or privacy at all Instead of answering Pinny Penny took a small cotton bag from the tallest of the Supervisors and handed it silently to the King Still half asleep Skamperoo untied the drawstring of the small bag and emptied the contents into his fat hand What he saw there made his eyes fly open C4 wide open Jewels The very thing for which he had been wishing Emeralds gasped the King rubbing the glittering necklace between his fingers Where did you get this Twobyfour They were sent to your Majesty by a merchant in the Second County who got them from a traveling peddler The peddler had got them from a Gilliken who had got them from a Quadling who had got them from a Munchkin who had once lived in the Emerald City of Oz OZ snapped the King sitting up very straight Where is Oz Oz is a great and powerful Kingdom on the other side of the Deadly Desert answered Twobyfour looking uneasily over his shoulder at Pinny Penny Then how did this peddler cross the desert demanded Skamperoo holding the necklace up to the light and feasting his eyes greedily on its gleaming emeralds That I cannot say Twobyfour cast a longing glance at the door heartily wishing himself on the other side Then perhaps you will tell us why you did not turn this necklace over to the king suggested Pinny Penny mournfully Yes how dared you keep it panted Skamperoo indignantly And what are you gaping at Threebysix Ill wager you were in this too He was shouted Twobyfour hoarsely He tried to steal the jewels from me Thats how he got the black eye But you tried to steal them from me and what about that my fine fellow Twobyfour turned a painful and uncomfortable scarlet under the Kings accusing eye In Skampavia we have so little your Majesty he stuttered miserably With these emeralds I thought I might buy a bit of land in some cooler and more comfortable country where my wife and boys could be happy C4 a country where flowers would grow in a garden and where a man would not have to spend his whole life wrestling with rocks and weeds and drilling for hours in the hot sun for no reason whatsoever Hah exclaimed Pinny Penny looking meaningly at the King Hah yourself grunted Skamperoo wrathfully Then as the emeralds continued to sparkle and glitter in his hand his anger subsided You did very wrong to keep the necklace Twobyfour he stated mildly But I have decided to forgive you Return now to the Second County and explain to the merchant who gave you this necklace that I must have all three All three exclaimed Twobyfour But hes entitled by law to two of them My word is the law here and you can choose between a broken law or a broken head Skamperoo told him calmly He is the KING murmured Pinny Penny in a quiet voice There was nothing sarcastic in the manner of his speech but something in the Prime Ministers expression made the King prickle with discomfort Yes I am the King he shouted explosively and moreover I have spoken Begone both of you and YOU Twobyfour have two days to return with those two necklaces The necklaces or your HEAD do you understand And C4 er C4 er C4 you may tell that merchant in your county that he need send no more of his wares to the capital the three necklaces will suffice he bellowed as the two Supervisors went bolting through the door Now nice they will suffice You are the King sniffed Pinny Penny with a sour smile Are you a parrot or a Prime Minister Stop repeating that silly stuff and tell me about Oz commanded Skamperoo clasping the emerald necklace around his fat throat Have you ever heard of this place Pinny Penny It must be a rich and marvelous country if peddlers can trade emerald necklaces as carelessly as we trade wooden beads It is a marvelous country answered Pinny Penny thoughtfully I remember m
