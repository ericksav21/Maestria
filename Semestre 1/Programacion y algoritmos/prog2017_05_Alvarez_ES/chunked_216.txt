ighness And wheres the Scarecrow Hes gone into the Munchkin country to get some fresh straw to stuff himself with in honor of Ozmas celebration replied the maid He returns to the Emerald City tomorrow he said By this time Toktok the Tin Woodman and the shaggy man had arrived and the chariot had gone around to the back of the palace Billina going with the Lion and Tiger to see her chickens after her absence from them But Toto stayed close beside Dorothy Come in please said Jellia Jamb it shall be our pleasant duty to escort all of you to the rooms prepared for your use The shaggy man hesitated Dorothy had never known him to be ashamed of his shaggy looks before but now that he was surrounded by so much magnificence and splendor the shaggy man felt sadly out of place Dorothy assured him that all her friends were welcome at Ozmas palace so he carefully dusted his shaggy shoes with his shaggy handkerchief and entered the grand hall after the others Tiktok lived at the Royal Palace and the Tin Woodman always had the same room whenever he visited Ozma so these two went at once to remove the dust of the journey from their shining bodies Dorothy also had a pretty suite of rooms which she always occupied when in the Emerald City but several servants walked ahead politely to show the way although she was quite sure she could find the rooms herself She took ButtonBright with her because he seemed too small to be left alone in such a big palace but Jellia Jamb herself ushered the beautiful Daughter of the Rainbow to her apartments because it was easy to see that Polychrome was used to splendid palaces and was therefore entitled to especial attention 19 The Shaggy Mans Welcome The shaggy man stood in the great hall his shaggy hat in his hands wondering what would become of him He had never been a guest in a fine palace before perhaps he had never been a guest anywhere In the big cold outside world people did not invite shaggy men to their homes and this shaggy man of ours had slept more in haylofts and stables than in comfortable rooms When the others left the great hall he eyed the splendidly dressed servants of the Princess Ozma as if he expected to be ordered out but one of them bowed before him as respectfully as if he had been a prince and said Permit me sir to conduct you to your apartments The shaggy man drew a long breath and took courage Very well he answered Im ready Through the big hall they went up the grand staircase carpeted thick with velvet and so along a wide corridor to a carved doorway Here the servant paused and opening the door said with polite deference Be good enough to enter sir and make yourself at home in the rooms our Royal Ozma has ordered prepared for you Whatever you see is for you to use and enjoy as if your own The Princess dines at seven and I shall be here in time to lead you to the drawingroom where you will be privileged to meet the lovely Ruler of Oz Is there any command in the meantime with which you desire to honor me No said the shaggy man but Im much obliged He entered the room and shut the door and for a time stood in bewilderment admiring the grandeur before him He had been given one of the handsomest apartments in the most magnificent palace in the world and you can not wonder that his good fortune astonished and awed him until he grew used to his surroundings The furniture was upholstered in cloth of gold with the royal crown embroidered upon it in scarlet The rug upon the marble floor was so thick and soft that he could not hear the sound of his own footsteps and upon the walls were splendid tapestries woven with scenes from the Land of Oz Books and ornaments were scattered about in profusion and the shaggy man thought he had never seen so many pretty things in one place before In one corner played a tinkling fountain of perfumed water and in another was a table bearing a golden tray loaded with freshly gathered fruit including several of the redcheeked apples that the shaggy man loved At the farther end of this charming room was an open doorway and he crossed over to find himself in a bedroom containing more comforts than the shaggy man had ever before imagined The bedstead was of gold and set with many brilliant diamonds and the coverlet had designs of pearls and rubies sewed upon it At one side of the bedroom was a dainty dressingroom with closets containing a large assortment of fresh clothing and beyond this was the batha large room having a marble pool big enough to swim in with white marble steps leading down to the water Around the edge of the pool were set rows of fine emeralds as large as doorknobs while the water of the bath was clear as crystal For a time the shaggy man gazed upon all this luxury with silent amazement Then he decided being wise in his way to take advantage of his good fortune He removed his shaggy boots and his shaggy clothing and bathed in the pool with rare enjoyment After he had dried himself with the soft towels he went into the dressingroom
