 Why you dont want to go away and leave me all alone do you asked the girl Besides if I go now I can wind up Tiktok so that he can make his last guess Very well then said the Scarecrow with a sigh Run along little Dorothy and may good luck go with you So Dorothy trying to be brave in spite of her fears passed through the doorway into the gorgeous rooms of the palace The stillness of the place awed her at first and the child drew short breaths and pressed her hand to her heart and looked all around with wondering eyes Yes it was a beautiful place but enchantments lurked in every nook and corner and she had not yet grown accustomed to the wizardries of these fairy countries so different from the quiet and sensible commonplaces of her own native land Slowly she passed through several rooms until she came upon Tiktok standing motionless It really seemed then that she had found a friend in this mysterious palace so she hastened to wind up the machine mans action and speech and thoughts Thank you Dorothy were his first words I have now one more guess to make Oh be very careful Tiktok wont you cried the girl Yes But the Nome King has us in his power and he has set a trap for us I fear we are all lost he answered I fear so too said Dorothy sadly If Smith Tinker had given me a guessing clockwork attachment continued Tiktok I might have defied the Nome King But my thoughts are plain and simple and are not of much use in this case Do the best you can said Dorothy encouragingly and if you fail I will watch and see what shape you are changed into So Tiktok touched a yellow glass vase that had daisies painted on one side and he spoke at the same time the word Ev In a flash the machine man had disappeared and although the girl looked quickly in every direction she could not tell which of the many ornaments the room contained had a moment before been her faithful friend and servant So all she could do was to accept the hopeless task set her and make her guesses and abide by the result It cant hurt very much she thought for I havent heard any of them scream or cry outnot even the poor officers Dear me I wonder if Uncle Henry or Aunt Em will ever know I have become an ornment in the Nome Kings palace and must stand forever and ever in one place and look prettycept when Im moved to be dusted It isnt the way I thought Id turn out at all but I spose it cant be helped She walked through all the rooms once more and examined with care all the objects they contained but there were so many they bewildered her and she decided after all as Ozma had done that it could be only guess work at the best and that the chances were much against her guessing aright Timidly she touched an alabaster bowl and said Ev Thats one failure anyhow she thought But how am I to know which thing is enchanted and which is not Next she touched the image of a purple kitten that stood on the corner of a mantel and as she pronounced the word Ev the kitten disappeared and a pretty fairhaired boy stood beside her At the same time a bell rang somewhere in the distance and as Dorothy started back partly in surprise and partly in joy the little one exclaimed Where am I And who are you And what has happened to me Well I declare said Dorothy Ive really done it Done what asked the boy Saved myself from being an ornament replied the girl with a laugh and saved you from being forever a purple kitten A purple kitten he repeated There IS no such thing I know she answered But there was a minute ago Dont you remember standing on a corner of the mantel Of course not I am a Prince of Ev and my name is Evring the little one announced proudly But my father the King sold my mother and all her children to the cruel ruler of the Nomes and after that I remember nothing at all A purple kitten cant be spected to remember Evring said Dorothy But now you are yourself again and Im going to try to save some of your brothers and sisters and perhaps your mother as well So come with me She seized the childs hand and eagerly hurried here and there trying to decide which object to choose next The third guess was another failure and so was the fourth and the fifth Little Evring could not imagine what she was doing but he trotted along beside her very willingly for he liked the new companion he had found Dorothys further quest proved unsuccessful but after her first disappointment was over the little girl was filled with joy and thankfulness to think that after all she had been able to save one member of the royal family of Ev and could restore the little Prince to his sorrowing country Now she might return to the terrible Nome King in safety carrying with her the prize she had won in the person of the fairhaired boy So she retraced her steps until she found the entrance to the palace and as she approached the massive doors of rock opened of their own accord allowing both Dorothy and Evring to pass the portals and enter the throne room 15 Billina Frightens the Nome King Now when Dorothy had enter
