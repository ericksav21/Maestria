 house and the children and the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the way Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search but nothing more so after a time they came back to the platform again Had there been any doors or windows in the lower rooms or had not the boards of the house been so thick and stout escape could have been easy but to remain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship and they did not like the darkness or the damp smell In this country as in all others they had visited underneath the earths surface there was no night a constant and strong light coming from some unknown source Looking out they could see into some of the houses near them where there were open windows in abundance and were able to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in their dwellings This seems to be their time of rest observed the Wizard All people need rest even if they are made of wood and as there is no night here they select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze I feel sleepy myself remarked Zeb yawning Why wheres Eureka cried Dorothy suddenly They all looked around but the kitten was no place to be seen Shes gone out for a walk said Jim gruffly Where On the roof asked the girl No she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides of this house to the ground She couldnt climb DOWN Jim said Dorothy To climb means to go up Who said so demanded the horse My schoolteacher said so and she knows a lot Jim To climb down is sometimes used as a figure of speech remarked the Wizard Well this was a figure of a cat said Jim and she WENT down anyhow whether she climbed or crept Dear me how careless Eureka is exclaimed the girl much distressed The Gurgles will get her sure Ha ha chuckled the old cabhorse theyre not Gurgles little maid theyre Gargoyles Never mind theyll get Eureka whatever theyre called No they wont said the voice of the kitten and Eureka herself crawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon the floor Wherever have you been Eureka asked Dorothy sternly Watching the wooden folks Theyre too funny for anything Dorothy Just now they are all going to bed andwhat do you thinkthey unhook the hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they wake up again What the hinges No the wings That said Zeb explains why this house is used by them for a prison If any of the Gargoyles act badly and have to be put in jail they are brought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them until they promise to be good The Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said I wish we had some of those loose wings he said Could we fly with them asked Dorothy I think so If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to fly lies in the wings themselves and not in the wooden bodies of the people who wear them So if we had the wings we could probably fly as well as they doas least while we are in their country and under the spell of its magic But how would it help us to be able to fly questioned the girl Come here said the little man and took her to one of the corners of the building Do you see that big rock standing on the hillside yonder he continued pointing with his finger Yes its a good way off but I can see it she replied Well inside that rock which reaches up into the clouds is an archway very much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairway from the Valley of Voe Ill get my spyglass and then you can see it more plainly He fetched a small but powerful telescope which had been in his satchel and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening Where does it lead to she asked That I cannot tell said the Wizard but we cannot now be far below the earths surface and that entrance may lead to another stairway that will bring us on top of our world again where we belong So if we had the wings and could escape the Gargoyles we might fly to that rock and be saved Ill get you the wings said Zeb who had thoughtfully listened to all this That is if the kitten will show me where they are But how can you get down enquired the girl wonderingly For answer Zeb began to unfasten Jims harness strap by strap and to buckle one piece to another until he had made a long leather strip that would reach to the ground I can climb down that all right he said No you cant remarked Jim with a twinkle in his round eyes You may GO down but you can only CLIMB up Well Ill climb up when I get back then said the boy with a laugh Now Eureka youll have to show me the way to those wings You must be very quiet warned the kitten for if you make the least noise the Gargoyles will wake up They can hear a pin drop Im not going to drop a pin said Zeb He had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy and now he let the line dangle over the side of the house Be careful cautioned Dorothy earnestly I will said the boy and let himself slide over the edge The girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his way carefully downwa
