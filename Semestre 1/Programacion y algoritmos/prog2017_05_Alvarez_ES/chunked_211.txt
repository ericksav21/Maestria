and then he chopped wood in the forests to earn his living But the axe slipped so often and cut off parts of himwhich he had replaced with tinthat finally there was no flesh left nothing but tin so he became a real tin woodman The wonderful Wizard of Oz had given him an excellent heart to replace his old one and he didnt at all mind being tin Every one loved him he loved every one and he was therefore as happy as the day was long The Emperor was proud of his new tin castle and showed his visitors through all the rooms Every bit of the furniture was made of brightly polished tinthe tables chairs beds and alleven the floors and walls were of tin I suppose said he that there are no cleverer tinsmiths in all the world than the Winkies It would be hard to match this castle in Kansas wouldnt it little Dorothy Very hard replied the child gravely It must have cost a lot of money remarked the shaggy man Money Money in Oz cried the Tin Woodman What a queer idea Did you suppose we are so vulgar as to use money here Why not asked the shaggy man If we used money to buy things with instead of love and kindness and the desire to please one another then we should be no better than the rest of the world declared the Tin Woodman Fortunately money is not known in the Land of Oz at all We have no rich and no poor for what one wishes the others all try to give him in order to make him happy and no one in all Oz cares to have more than he can use Good cried the shaggy man greatly pleased to hear this I also despise moneya man in Butterfield owes me fifteen cents and I will not take it from him The Land of Oz is surely the most favored land in all the world and its people the happiest I should like to live here always The Tin Woodman listened with respectful attention Already he loved the shaggy man although he did not yet know of the Love Magnet So he said If you can prove to the Princess Ozma that you are honest and true and worthy of our friendship you may indeed live here all your days and be as happy as we are Ill try to prove that said the shaggy man earnestly And now continued the Emperor you must all go to your rooms and prepare for dinner which will presently be served in the grand tin dininghall I am sorry Shaggy Man that I can not offer you a change of clothing but I dress only in tin myself and I suppose that would not suit you I care little about dress said the shaggy man indifferently So I should imagine replied the Emperor with true politeness They were shown to their rooms and permitted to make such toilets as they could and soon they assembled again in the grand tin dininghall even Toto being present For the Emperor was fond of Dorothys little dog and the girl explained to her friends that in Oz all animals were treated with as much consideration as the peopleif they behave themselves she added Toto behaved himself and sat in a tin highchair beside Dorothy and ate his dinner from a tin platter Indeed they all ate from tin dishes but these were of pretty shapes and brightly polished Dorothy thought they were just as good as silver ButtonBright looked curiously at the man who had no appetite inside him for the Tin Woodman although he had prepared so fine a feast for his guests ate not a mouthful himself sitting patiently in his place to see that all built so they could eat were well and plentifully served What pleased ButtonBright most about the dinner was the tin orchestra that played sweet music while the company ate The players were not tin being just ordinary Winkies but the instruments they played upon were all tintin trumpets tin fiddles tin drums and cymbals and flutes and horns and all They played so nicely the Shining Emperor Waltz composed expressly in honor of the Tin Woodman by Mr H M Wogglebug TE that Polly could not resist dancing to it After she had tasted a few dewdrops freshly gathered for her she danced gracefully to the music while the others finished their repast and when she whirled until her fleecy draperies of rainbow hues enveloped her like a cloud the Tin Woodman was so delighted that he clapped his tin hands until the noise of them drowned the sound of the cymbals Altogether it was a merry meal although Polychrome ate little and the host nothing at all Im sorry the Rainbows Daughter missed her mistcakes said the Tin Woodman to Dorothy but by a mistake Miss Pollys mistcakes were mislaid and not missed until now Ill try to have some for her breakfast They spent the evening telling stories and the next morning left the splendid tin castle and set out upon the road to the Emerald City The Tin Woodman went with them of course having by this time been so brightly polished that he sparkled like silver His axe which he always carried with him had a steel blade that was tin plated and a handle covered with tin plate beautifully engraved and set with diamonds The Winkies assembled before the castle gates and cheered their Emperor as he marched away and it was easy to see that they all loved him dear
