Wizard and all his magic Ozma and the rulers of the four Oz countries to the inaccessible caverns of Thunder Mountain Now while Matiah is trying his best to discover the trick of the magic emeralds Skamperoo growing tired of the tempery fellow appealed to his horse The horse being magically brought to life and being unusually sharpwitted and quick soon worked out the problem With his help Skamperoo wished the spell of forgetting upon Ozmas subjects banished her Highness and all of the others just as Matiah had suggested and managed to rule Oz for three whole days But what became of Matiah asked Glinda leaning forward eagerly At this moment Matiah is lying in a senseless condition in the underground chamber beneath this castle Bitty Bit told them solemnly and without opening his eyes Soon after Skamperoo left for Oz the merchant was driven out of Skampavia by Pinny Penny whom Skamperoo had made King Matiah furious to think the apparently stupid sovereign had outwitted him bribed an eagle to carry him across the desert arrived at the Emerald City and soon afterward managed to really steal the necklaces from Skamperoo Discovering beneath the cellar the excavated chambers of the old Gnome King he retired to this quiet spot to again experiment with the emeralds Needing another person to help he seized the Kitchen Boy who had come to the cellar for supplies and forced him to assist in his experiments How soon he might have discovered the real trick of the chains I cannot say but our own arrival and Glomas powder of darkness happily interrupted him The Kitchen Boy who had kept his eyes glued to the stone steps and trapdoor during the entire morning made an immediate dash for freedom and managed to escape in spite of the darkness Matiah not so fortunate rushed into a stone pillar and knocked himself senseless Hes still lying there and I suggest that your Majesty deal with him at once I will decided Ozma firmly as Bitty Bit opened his eyes and looked cheerfully around the table And Ill do it by means of these very magic emeralds Put on the emeralds Dorothy for you alone know the secret of their magic power So Dorothy anxious to have Matiah out of Oz before he recovered his wicked wits hastily clasped the three chains around her slim throat It is my earnest wish that Matiah shall immediately and henceforth forget the emerald necklaces of Oz return to his country and become a good and simple citizen of Skampavia said Ozma seriously beginning her count to one hundred Hes gone Hes gone piped up Bitty Bit who had closed his eyes as soon as Ozma started to speak And if I were you my dear I would send off that red eagle too I see him lurking on the edge of our city with an exceedingly fierce light in his eye So Ozma made another wish turning the eagle to a harmless sparrow And what about Skamperoo asked Cheeriobed King of the Munchkins who up to this time had not spoken a word Should he not be punished in some way I would not bother with old Skamper advised Bitty Bit with a small chuckle Before I agreed to give his white horse those five wishes I closed my eyes looked ahead and discovered that they would all be good wishes Not only good but wise and from now on I think you can trust that clever white horse and a little fellow called Pinny Penny to keep their Master out of mischief and Oz Well in that case sighed Ozma rather breathless from so much counting everything is happily settled And in that case boomed Joe King gallantly helping his little Queen to her feet I suggest we start celebrating all over again not only the discovery of Oz by mortals but the saving of Oz as well I for one feel terribly cheated at missing Nottas circus So do I So do I exclaimed the little Prince Philador climbing boisterously into Highboys saddle I want to see a circus And so you shall promised Ozma gaily We will start the celebration at exactly the point where we left Oz for Thunder Mountain and have the tableaux the pageants and the picnics all over again And that my dear is exactly what they did do and everyone including Bitty Bit enjoyed themselves so much there was not an unhappy person in the Emerald City And not until the end of the second day did Dorothy remember to tell Ozma the magic secret of the wishing emeralds On the sixth count you wink both eyes whispered Dorothy giving Ozma a little hug Good night Good gracious so THATS it smiled Ozma comprehending instantly what Dorothy meant I suppose Matiah did it in sheer excitement the first time Well I have often heard of doing things in the twinkling of an eye but now we shall really be able to have them that way No one knows this secret but you and me and a white horse and no one must ever know it for wishes are dangerous and cause more unhappiness than joy so well never tell another soul will we Dorothy Never agreed the little girl looking solemnly over her shoulder at the safe where Ozma had hidden her new treasure CHAPTER 20 BACK IN SKAMPAVIA So there you are Pinny Penny straighten
