fully handsome faces There was not an ugly person in all the throng yet Dorothy was not especially pleased by the appearance of these people because their features had no more expression than the faces of dolls They did not smile nor did they frown or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness They simply started at the strangers paying most attention to Jim and Eureka for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and the children bore an outward resemblance to themselves Pretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in the dark hair just over his forehead He seemed to be a person of authority for the others pressed back to give him room After turning his composed eyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to Zeb who was a little taller than Dorothy Tell me intruder was it you who caused the Rain of Stones For a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question Then remembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them long before they had reached this place he answered No sir we didnt cause anything It was the earthquake The man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over this speech Then he asked What is an earthquake I dont know said Zeb who was still confused But Dorothy seeing his perplexity answered Its a shaking of the earth In this quake a big crack opened and we fell throughhorse and buggy and alland the stones got loose and came down with us The man with the star regarded her with his calm expressionless eyes The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city he said and we shall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence How can we do that asked the girl That I am not prepared to say It is your affair not mine You must go to the House of the Sorcerer who will soon discover the truth Where is the House of the Sorcerer the girl enquired I will lead you to it Come He turned and walked down the street and after a moments hesitation Dorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy The boy took his seat beside her and said Giddap Jim As the horse ambled along drawing the buggy the people of the glass city made way for them and formed a procession in their rear Slowly they moved down one street and up another turning first this way and then that until they came to an open square in the center of which was a big glass palace having a central dome and four tall spires on each corner 3 The Arrival Of The Wizard The doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse and buggy to enter so Zeb drove straight through it and the children found themselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful The people at once followed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the center of the hall Come to us oh Gwig called the man in a loud voice Instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor then it slowly spread and ascended into the dome disclosing a strange personage seated upon a glass throne just before Jims nose He was formed just as were the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing only differed from theirs in being bright yellow But he had no hair at all and all over his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharp thorns like those found on the branches of rosebushes There was even a thorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that Dorothy laughed when she saw him The Sorcerer hearing the laugh looked toward the little girl with cold cruel eyes and his glance made her grow sober in an instant Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded Land of the Mangaboos he asked sternly Cause we couldnt help it said Dorothy Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack and break our houses he continued We didnt declared the girl Prove it cried the Sorcerer We dont have to prove it answered Dorothy indignantly If you had any sense at all youd known it was the earthquake We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us which did much damage and injured some of our people Today came another Rain of Stones and soon after it you appeared among us By the way said the man with the star looking steadily at the Sorcerer you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rain of Stones Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first What is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth My sorcery does tell the truth declared the thorncovered man I said there would be but one Rain of Stones This second one was a Rain of PeopleandHorseandBuggy And some stones came with them Will there be any more Rains asked the man with the star No my Prince Neither stones nor people No my Prince Are you sure Quite sure my Prince My sorcery tells me so Just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Prince after making a low bow More wonders in the air my Lord said he Immediately the Prince and all of
