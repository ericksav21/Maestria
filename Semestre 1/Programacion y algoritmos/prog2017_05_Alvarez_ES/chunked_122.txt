and guess which ornaments are the Queen of Ev and her children Why you stupid rascal it is more fun this way returned the King and it serves to keep me amused for a long time But suppose some of them happen to guess aright persisted the Steward then you would lose your old ornaments and these new ones too There is no chance of their guessing aright replied the monarch with a laugh How could they know that the Queen of Ev and her family are all ornaments of a royal purple color But there are no other purple ornaments in the palace said the Steward There are many other colors however and the purple ones are scattered throughout the rooms and are of many different shapes and sizes Take my word for it Steward they will never think of choosing the purple ornaments Billina squatting under the throne had listened carefully to all this talk and now chuckled softly to herself as she heard the King disclose his secret Still you are acting foolishly by running the chance continued the Steward roughly and it is still more foolish of you to transform all those people from Oz into green ornaments I did that because they came from the Emerald City replied the King and I had no green ornaments in my collection until now I think they will look quite pretty mixed with the others Dont you The Steward gave an angry grunt Have your own way since you are the King he growled But if you come to grief through your carelessness remember that I told you so If I wore the magic belt which enables you to work all your transformations and gives you so much other power I am sure I would make a much wiser and better King than you are Oh cease your tiresome chatter commanded the King getting angry again Because you are my Chief Steward you have an idea you can scold me as much as you please But the very next time you become impudent I will send you to work in the furnaces and get another Nome to fill your place Now follow me to my chamber for I am going to bed And see that I am wakened early tomorrow morning I want to enjoy the fun of transforming the rest of these people into ornaments What color will you make the Kansas girl asked the Steward Gray I think said his Majesty And the Scarecrow and the machine man Oh they shall be of solid gold because they are so ugly in real life Then the voices died away and Billina knew that the King and his Steward had left the room She fixed up some of her tail feathers that were not straight and then tucked her head under her wing again and went to sleep In the morning Dorothy and the Lion and Tiger were given their breakfast in their rooms and afterward joined the King in his throne room The Tiger complained bitterly that he was half starved and begged to go into the palace and become an ornament so that he would no longer suffer the pangs of hunger Havent you had your breakfast asked the Nome King Oh I had just a bite replied the beast But what good is a bite to a hungry tiger He ate seventeen bowls of porridge a platter full of fried sausages eleven loaves of bread and twentyone mince pies said the Steward What more do you want demanded the King A fat baby I want a fat baby said the Hungry Tiger A nice plump juicy tender fat baby But of course if I had one my conscience would not allow me to eat it So Ill have to be an ornament and forget my hunger Impossible exclaimed the King Ill have no clumsy beasts enter my palace to overturn and break all my pretty nicknacks When the rest of your friends are transformed you can return to the upper world and go about your business As for that we have no business when our friends are gone said the Lion So we do not care much what becomes of us Dorothy begged to be allowed to go first into the palace but Tiktok firmly maintained that the slave should face danger before the mistress The Scarecrow agreed with him in that so the Nome King opened the door for the machine man who tramped into the palace to meet his fate Then his Majesty returned to his throne and puffed his pipe so contentedly that a small cloud of smoke formed above his head Bye and bye he said Im sorry there are so few of you left Very soon now my fun will be over and then for amusement I shall have nothing to do but admire my new ornaments It seems to me said Dorothy that you are not so honest as you pretend to be Hows that asked the King Why you made us think it would be easy to guess what ornaments the people of Ev were changed into It IS easy declared the monarch if one is a good guesser But it appears that the members of your party are all poor guessers What is Tiktok doing now asked the girl uneasily Nothing replied the King with a frown He is standing perfectly still in the middle of a room Oh I expect hes run down said Dorothy I forgot to wind him up this morning How many guesses has he made All that he is allowed except one answered the King Suppose you go in and wind him up and then you can stay there and make your own guesses All right said Dorothy It is my turn next declared the Scarecrow
