CHAPTER 1 SAIL HO Eight miles east of Pingaree lies the eightsided island of King Ato the Eighth While not so large as Pingaree the Octagon Isle is nevertheless one of the tidiest and most pleasing of the sea realms that dot the great green rolling expanses of the Nonestic Ocean And Ato himself is as pleasing as his island enormously fat and jolly with a kind word for everyone In his eightsided castle he has every modern convenience and comfort and some of which even an uptodate country like our own cannot boast For instance take Roger his Royal Read Bird Roger besides knowing eight languages can read aloud for hours at a time without growing hoarse or weary So Ato never has to strain his eyes poring over his eight hundred huge volumes of adventure and history or his arms holding a newspaper or court document or his jaw pronouncing the names of kings and countries in Ev and Oz and other curious places on the mainland west of his own island And Roger is as handsome as he is handy his head and bill rather like a ducks his body shaped and colored like a parrot but much larger while his tail opens out into an enormous fan This is extremely fortunate for the Octagon Isle is semitropical in climate and on warm sultry days Roger not only reads to his Majesty but fans him as well All in all Atos life is decidedly luxurious and lazy Sixentwo Chief Chancellor of the realm and Fournfour its treasurer attend to all the business of governing so that Ato and Roger have little to do but enjoy themselves The Octagon Islanders one hundred and eighty in number are a sober and industrious lot rarely giving any trouble Once it is true they sailed off and deserted the King entirely but Ato with Peter a Philadelphia boy and Samuel Salt a pirate who landed on the island at just the right moment immediately set out after them using the pirates stout ship the Crescent Moon for the purpose By a strange coincidence Samuel Salts men had also mutinied and sailed away so that there were two sets of deserters to seek out and discover After a dangerous and lively voyage the Crescent Moon reached the rocky shores of Menankypoo on the Mainland Here they learned that the Octagon Islanders and Samuel Salts men had been enslaved by Ruggedo the former Gnome King and marched off to conquer the Emerald City of Oz How Peter and the Pirate Ato and a poetical Pig outwitted the Gnome King is a long and other story You have probably read it yourself But ever since their hairraising experiences with Ruggedo and their rescue by Ato the Octagon Islanders have been perfectly satisfied with their own ruler and country In fact they were so docile and devoted so fearfully anxious to please Ato often wished they would revolt or sass him a little just to relieve the monotony and make life more interesting To tell the truth after serving as cook mate and ablebodied seaman on the Crescent Moon Ato found it quite boring to settle down to a humdrum life of a monarch ashore Roger too missed the gay and carefree life he had led as a pirate and could not even pretend an interest in the books of adventure he still dutifully read to his Master He and Ato now spent most of their time on the edge of the Island C4 the King in a comfortable hammock swung between two palm trees Roger on a tall golden perch set close beside him Whenever the Read Bird paused to yawn or turn a page Ato would pull himself up to a sitting position raise the telescope he always had with him and gaze long and wistfully out to sea Many ships passed Atos Island but never a one in the least resembling the splendid threemasted fast sailing ship belonging to the Pirate Youll give yourself a fine squint there warned Roger one morning as Ato for about the hundredth time raised his spy glass And what is the use of it pray inquired Roger grumpily ruffling the pages of the Book of Barons Samuel Salt has probably forgotten all about us and gone off by himself on a voyage of discovery No No Sammy wouldnt do that said the King shaking his head positively He promised to stop by for us on the very first voyage he made as Royal Discoverer of Oz Ho one of those seafaring promises muttered Roger A pirates promise Humph His new honors have gone to his head Quite a jump from pirating to exploring Ill wager a wing hes gone back to buccaneering and forgotten us altogether Now Roger how can you say that Heaving up his huge bulk with great difficulty Ato looked reproachfully at his Royal Read Bird Sammy never cared for pirating in the first place wheezed the King earnestly and he was so softhearted about planking the captives and burning the ships his band sailed off and left him They only made him Captain because he was clever at navigating and you know perfectly well he spent more time looking for flora and fauna than for ships and treasures Ah then I suppose some wild Flora or Fauna has him in its clutches observed Roger sarcastically and a likely thing that is seeing the poor Captain weighs but two hundred and twenty
