d now another joined them appearing on another rock Our friends had come to a little hollow in the hills and the place where they now stood was surrounded by jagged peaks of rock except where the road ran through Now there are four of them said the shaggy man Five declared Polychrome Six said Dorothy Lots of em cried ButtonBright and so there werequite a row of the twosided black and white creatures sitting on the rocks all around Toto stopped barking and ran between Dorothys feet where he crouched down as if afraid The creatures did not look pleasant or friendly to be sure and the shaggy mans donkey face became solemn indeed Ask em who they are and what they want whispered Dorothy so the shaggy man called out in a loud voice Who are you Scoodlers they yelled in chorus their voices sharp and shrill What do you want called the shaggy man You they yelled pointing their thin fingers at the group and they all flopped around so they were white and then all flopped back again so they were black But what do you want us for asked the shaggy man uneasily Soup they all shouted as if with one voice Goodness me said Dorothy trembling a little the Scoodlers must be reglar cannibals Dont want to be soup protested ButtonBright beginning to cry Hush dear said the little girl trying to comfort him we dont any of us want to be soup But dont worry the shaggy man will take care of us Will he asked Polychrome who did not like the Scoodlers at all and kept close to Dorothy Ill try promised the shaggy man but he looked worried Happening just then to feel the Love Magnet in his pocket he said to the creatures with more confidence Dont you love me Yes they shouted all together Then you mustnt harm me or my friends said the shaggy man firmly We love you in soup they yelled and in a flash turned their white sides to the front How dreadful said Dorothy This is a time Shaggy Man when you get loved too much Dont want to be soup wailed ButtonBright again and Toto began to whine dismally as if he didnt want to be soup either The only thing to do said the shaggy man to his friends in a low tone is to get out of this pocket in the rocks as soon as we can and leave the Scoodlers behind us Follow me my dears and dont pay any attention to what they do or say With this he began to march along the road to the opening in the rocks ahead and the others kept close behind him But the Scoodlers closed up in front as if to bar their way and so the shaggy man stooped down and picked up a loose stone which he threw at the creatures to scare them from the path At this the Scoodlers raised a howl Two of them picked their heads from their shoulders and hurled them at the shaggy man with such force that he fell over in a heap greatly astonished The two now ran forward with swift leaps caught up their heads and put them on again after which they sprang back to their positions on the rocks 10 Escaping the SoupKettle The shaggy man got up and felt of himself to see if he was hurt but he was not One of the heads had struck his breast and the other his left shoulder yet though they had knocked him down the heads were not hard enough to bruise him Come on he said firmly weve got to get out of here some way and forward he started again The Scoodlers began yelling and throwing their heads in great numbers at our frightened friends The shaggy man was knocked over again and so was ButtonBright who kicked his heels against the ground and howled as loud as he could although he was not hurt a bit One head struck Toto who first yelped and then grabbed the head by an ear and started running away with it The Scoodlers who had thrown their heads began to scramble down and run to pick them up with wonderful quickness but the one whose head Toto had stolen found it hard to get it back again The head couldnt see the body with either pair of its eyes because the dog was in the way so the headless Scoodler stumbled around over the rocks and tripped on them more than once in its effort to regain its top Toto was trying to get outside the rocks and roll the head down the hill but some of the other Scoodlers came to the rescue of their unfortunate comrade and pelted the dog with their own heads until he was obliged to drop his burden and hurry back to Dorothy The little girl and the Rainbows Daughter had both escaped the shower of heads but they saw now that it would be useless to try to run away from the dreadful Scoodlers We may as well submit declared the shaggy man in a rueful voice as he got upon his feet again He turned toward their foes and asked What do you want us to do Come they cried in a triumphant chorus and at once sprang from the rocks and surrounded their captives on all sides One funny thing about the Scoodlers was they could walk in either direction coming or going without turning around because they had two faces and as Dorothy said two front sides and their feet were shaped like the letter T upside down They moved with great rapidity and there was something abou
