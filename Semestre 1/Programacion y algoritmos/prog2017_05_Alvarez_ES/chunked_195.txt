in the Kansas girls chubby hand Youll be my friendwont you she said pleadingly Of course And what is your name Im Dorothy and this is my friend Shaggy Man who owns the Love Magnet and this is ButtonBrightonly you dont see him as he really is because the FoxKing carelessly changed his head into a fox head But the real ButtonBright is good to look at and I hope to get him changed back to himself some time The Rainbows Daughter nodded cheerfully no longer afraid of her new companions But who is this she asked pointing to Toto who was sitting before her wagging his tail in the most friendly manner and admiring the pretty maid with his bright eyes Is this also some enchanted person Oh no PollyI may call you Polly maynt I Your whole names awful hard to say Call me Polly if you wish Dorothy Well Polly Totos just a dog but he has more sense than ButtonBright to tell the truth and Im very fond of him So am I said Polychrome bending gracefully to pat Totos head But how did the Rainbows Daughter ever get on this lonely road and become lost asked the shaggy man who had listened wonderingly to all this Why my father stretched his rainbow over here this morning so that one end of it touched this road was the reply and I was dancing upon the pretty rays as I love to do and never noticed I was getting too far over the bend in the circle Suddenly I began to slide and I went faster and faster until at last I bumped on the ground at the very end Just then father lifted the rainbow again without noticing me at all and though I tried to seize the end of it and hold fast it melted away entirely and I was left alone and helpless on the cold hard earth It doesnt seem cold to me Polly said Dorothy but perhaps youre not warmly dressed Im so used to living nearer the sun replied the Rainbows Daughter that at first I feared I would freeze down here But my dance has warmed me some and now I wonder how I am ever to get home again Wont your father miss you and look for you and let down another rainbow for you Perhaps so but hes busy just now because it rains in so many parts of the world at this season and he has to set his rainbow in a lot of different places What would you advise me to do Dorothy Come with us was the answer Im going to try to find my way to the Emerald City which is in the fairy Land of Oz The Emerald City is ruled by a friend of mine the Princess Ozma and if we can manage to get there Im sure she will know a way to send you home to your father again Do you really think so asked Polychrome anxiously Im pretty sure Then Ill go with you said the little maid for travel will help keep me warm and father can find me in one part of the world as well as anotherif he gets time to look for me Come along then said the shaggy man cheerfully and they started on once more Polly walked beside Dorothy a while holding her new friends hand as if she feared to let it go but her nature seemed as light and buoyant as her fleecy robes for suddenly she darted ahead and whirled round in a giddy dance Then she tripped back to them with sparkling eyes and smiling cheeks having regained her usual happy mood and forgotten all her worry about being lost They found her a charming companion and her dancing and laughterfor she laughed at times like the tinkling of a silver belldid much to enliven their journey and keep them contented 6 The City Of Beasts When noon came they opened the FoxKings basket of luncheon and found a nice roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and some slices of bread and butter As they sat on the grass by the roadside the shaggy man cut up the turkey with his pocketknife and passed slices of it around Havent you any dewdrops or mistcakes or cloudbuns asked Polychrome longingly Course not replied Dorothy We eat solid things down here on the earth But theres a bottle of cold tea Try some wont you The Rainbows Daughter watched ButtonBright devour one leg of the turkey Is it good she asked He nodded Do you think I could eat it Not this said ButtonBright But I mean another piece Dont know he replied Well Im going to try for Im very hungry she decided and took a thin slice of the white breast of turkey which the shaggy man cut for her as well as a bit of bread and butter When she tasted it Polychrome thought the turkey was goodbetter even than mistcakes but a little satisfied her hunger and she finished with a tiny sip of cold tea Thats about as much as a fly would eat said Dorothy who was making a good meal herself But I know some people in Oz who eat nothing at all Who are they inquired the shaggy man One is a scarecrow whos stuffed with straw and the other a woodman made out of tin They havent any appetites inside of em you see so they never eat anything at all Are they alive asked ButtonBright Oh yes replied Dorothy and theyre very clever and very nice too If we get to Oz Ill introduce them to you Do you really expect to get to Oz inquired the shaggy man taking a drink of cold tea I dont know just what to spect answered the child
