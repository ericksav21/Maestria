 that Roger with a shudder of distaste fled back to the cheerful company of Samuel and Ato But later when Samuel had gone below to pot the precious plants from Patrippany Island and the ships cook was leaning over the rail conversing cozily with the hippopotamus Roger flew back to Tandys cabin resolved to help him if he could With calm satisfaction he noted that Tandy had eaten everything on the tray Lying on his back the young King of Ozamaland was staring solemnly up at the beams over his bunk Ahoy And what goes on here cried Roger settling down on the old sea chest How about a turn on deck my lad and a bit of chatter with the crew It is not seemly for a King and son of a Kings son to talk with his inferiors observed Tandy coldly Infeeriors screeched Roger forgetting all his good intentions and mad enough to nip the youngsters nose right off Are you by any chance referring to me Ozamaland is a great and powerful country and I am its King stated Tandy turning his back on the Read Bird At this Roger let out another screech and then suddenly remembering the purpose of his visit took a long breath to steady himself When he spoke again his voice was both calm and reasonable Ozamaland may be a great and powerful country and you may also be its King but remember that you are no longer in Ozamaland explained Roger firmly You are on this ship by the express wish and kindness of the Captain and in the company of Kings and BETTER WAIT Shaking a claw at Tandys back Roger flew off to fetch one of Atos books from the shelf above the stove Tandy was in the same position when he returned but paying him no further attention Roger pulled the lamp nearer and opened his volume When a King is in the company of Kings began the Read Bird impressively he is no longer a special or royal being but merely a man among men and as such must maintain his honor and standing by sheer worth and ability alone Who says that What are you reading Tandy sat up with sudden interest for his whole life had been spent in study and reflection and the voice of the Read Bird was not unlike the voice of Woodjabegoodja his royal instructor at home I am reading Maxims for Monarchs answered Roger calmly a book of great authority and antiquity that has been used by the Rulers of Oz and Ev and the Nonestic Islands these many thousand years No great and important country would think of being without a copy of this book he continued severely Strange then that I should not have heard of it mused Tandy looking not quite so sure of himself We have no Maxims for Monarchs in Ozamaland Pooh Ozamaland Roger dismissed the whole country with a shrug of his wing A country as young and unimportant as that would probably know nothing about such matters You mean my country is not so old or important as Oz and this twopenny island of your fat Master shouted Tandy angrily Of course not Why its not even been discovered and whoever has been there demanded Roger disdainfully Take you as its King acting in this small upcountry fashion What CAN a fellow think HereFF20C4 Shoving the book toward the disagreeable young monarch the Read Bird urged him to look for himself With a puzzled frown Tandy reread the passage Roger had just quoted Well even though your Master is a King youre not a King and neither is Samuel Salt said Tandy looking at Roger with some of his former arrogance Oh isnt he Well just lay to this young fellow Roger shook his claw under Tandys upturned nose Samuel Salt is Captain of this ship a Knight and the Royal Discoverer of Oz which makes him seventy times as important as you King Pins He not only is boss of the Crescent Moon but he ruled the sea discovering countries for other Kings to govern and if it were not for Samuel Salt and people like him there wouldnt be any Kingdoms or people like you to run them See As for me Im a Royal Read Bird and wouldnt be a King for a minute I can live my own life and go and come as I please Then while Im on this ship Im not a King at all said Tandy wonderingly Then what am I What am I supposed to do The little boy looked puzzled and positively frightened Why youre supposed to act like a person that is if possible sniffed Roger reaching over for his book and looking at Tandy sideways down his bill What are you besides a King What can you do that is useful or interesting Do DO Tandys voice rose shrilly Why er why I can draw pictures and ride an elephant Good Roger put up his claw to hide the grin that in spite of his best efforts began to spread round his bill Well there isnt much call for drawing or elephantriding on a ship but you can draw water to swab the decks and Ill teach you to ride the yards and follow the crosstree to the main topgallant mast in the blowingest blow that ever blowed And depend upon it young man youll have more fun as a person than you ever had as a King Theres no place for having fun like a ship Fun said Tandy flatly and inquiringly Whats that Tar and tobaccy jack What are you tellin me Roger almost top
