t when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he announced that the balloon was ready But we must have a basket to ride in he said So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon When it was all ready Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket just touched the ground Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice I am now going away to make a visit While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you I command you to obey him as you would me The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky Come Dorothy cried the Wizard Hurry up or the balloon will fly away I cant find Toto anywhere replied Dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and Dorothy at last found him She picked him up and ran towards the balloon She was within a few steps of it and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and the balloon rose into the air without her Come back she screamed I want to go too I cant come back my dear called Oz from the basket Goodbye Goodbye shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz the Wonderful Wizard though he may have reached Omaha safely and be there now for all we know But the people remembered him lovingly and said to one another Oz was always our friend When he was here he built for us this beautiful Emerald City and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us Still for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard and would not be comforted 18 Away to the South Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon And she also felt sorry at losing Oz and so did her companions The Tin Woodman came to her and said Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone if you will kindly wipe away my tears so that I shall not rust With pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel When he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oilcan to guard against mishap The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him For they said there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man And so far as they knew they were quite right The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz the four travelers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him We are not so unlucky said the new ruler for this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us and we can do just as we please When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmers cornfield and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City I am quite satisfied with my lot I also said the Tin Woodman am wellpleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing I wished in all the world For my part I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the Lion modestly If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City continued the Scarecrow we might all be happy together But I dont want to live here cried Dorothy I want to go to Kansas and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry Well then what can be done inquired the Woodman The Scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains Finally he said Why not call the Winged Monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert I never thought of that said Dorothy joyfully Its just the thing Ill go at once for the Golden Cap When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of
