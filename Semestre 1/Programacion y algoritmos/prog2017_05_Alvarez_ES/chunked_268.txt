 throne So thats where he comes from breathed Dorothy forgetting Bitty Bits request for silence Oh quick tell us more C4 tell us more and help us to restore Ozma and the other lost sovereigns to power I am only a seer answered the sage opening his eyes wide and suddenly I can see and foresee tell and foretell but I cannot change that which has happened or is about to happen But where is Ozma demanded Pigasus edging closer If you are a seer and can see er at least you can tell us where she is In this way Pigasus hoped to check up the information given them by Potaroo the Gnome Kings Wizard So again Bitty Bit closed his eyes and pressing his fingers to his forehead spoke Ozma my old friend Jinnicky the Wizard of Oz a soldier with green whiskers a purple horse two Queens two Kings a Prince the Tin Woodman and Glinda the Good Sorceress are lying at the bottom of Lightning Lake which is on the top of Thunder Mountain Bitty Bit told them solemnly Lightning Lake cried Dorothy seizing the little seer frantically by the shoulders Why then they must be drowned burned and destroyed altogether No no they are quite calm and as usual Bitty Bit assured her hastily In fact they are I should say in a trance of some kind But whatll we do howll we disenchant them or find Thunder Mountain Loosing her hold on Bitty Bit Dorothy spun round three times and then started firmly for the door My shooting tower will take you to Thunder Mountain or any other place you decide you must go promised Bitty Bit hurrying anxiously after the little girl but not tonight Dorothy not tonight We are all tired and I must have time to think The conquering of Oz is a great shock to me I would like time to look into the matter more fully and consider all of these strange events in their proper order This problem shall be my pillow Ill sleep on it my dear and in the morning will doubtless have something helpful to suggest Well then wherere the beds yawned Pigasus who heartily approved of Bitty Bits suggestion Or are we to sleep on our problems too At this Bitty Bit who seemed to find Pigasus terribly amusing laughed right out loud then taking Dorothys arm he led the way to a snug little bedroom all done in yellow Pigasus had a gentlemanly apartment in tan next door and both were so weary they spent little time examining their new quarters but instead went directly to bed and to sleep When Dorothy wakened next morning she looked out the window and saw Pigasus flying in slow circles round the tidy castle Bitty Bits brown stone palace though small and unpretentious perched right on top of Some Summit and the view was so fine and the mountain air so fresh and invigorating Dorothy in spite of all her anxiety and worry began to feel happy and reckless and ready for anything With cheerful little glances round her cozy yellow room she dressed brushed her hair till it shone then skipped merrily down the brown marble steps and out into the garden The garden really a series of sloping terraces was bright with hardy mountain posies with spicy sage bushes and gnarled old trees which clung like acrobats to the steep rocks and dangerous crevices Pigasus catching a glimpse of Dorothy seated on a smooth rock near a little waterfall came swooping down to wish her a merry morning Not a bad little palace remarked the pig considerately Not a bad little palace at all though so far as I can see theres not a manservant or a woman servant or even a ladybug about I imagine this fellow is a hermit and from the looks of him probably lives on tobacco and snuff What do you suppose are the chances for breakfast I dont know said Dorothy refusing to allow such a small matter as breakfast to dash her spirits Have you seen Bitty Bit this morning Yes sniffed Pigasus beginning to poke his nose hungrily round the roots of a dwarf oak before I flew out my window I saw him going into his brown study Seer goes into brown study Hows that for the first announcement of the day Youre awful laughed Dorothy giving Pigasus a little push No just awfully hungry grinned Pigasus Now Ive been thinkingFF20C4 NO Stepping out from behind a sizable bush Bitty Bit regarded the pig with an air of assumed amazement He says hes been thinking he repeated turning solemnly to Dorothy Must be the air up here Thats about all Ive had retorted Pigasus savagely crunching an acorn between his teeth that and a nibble from one of your sage bushes Sage bush eh chuckled Bitty Bit winking at Dorothy Thats good and well make a sage of you yet a sausage he whispered in an undertone that Pigasus heard quite distinctly And speaking of sausage how about breakfast Though Bitty Bits remark about the sausage still rankled Pigasus was too hungry to let it keep him from following the seer into a small walled garden that opened out from the larger dining hall of his castle Here on a small table covered with a gay yellow cloth was assembled the most appetizing breakfast Dorothy ever had tasted Ripe melon and apricots cereal and eggs tiny
