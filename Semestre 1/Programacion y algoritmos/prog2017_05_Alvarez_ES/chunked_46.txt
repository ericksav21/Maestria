 no playmates so he did not know that boys often dig out the inside of a pumpkinjack and in the space thus made put a lighted candle to render the face more startling but he conceived an idea of his own that promised to be quite as effective He decided to manufacture the form of a man who would wear this pumpkin head and to stand it in a place where old Mombi would meet it face to face And then said Tip to himself with a laugh shell squeal louder than the brown pig does when I pull her tail and shiver with fright worse than I did last year when I had the ague He had plenty of time to accomplish this task for Mombi had gone to a villageto buy groceries she saidand it was a journey of at least two days So he took his axe to the forest and selected some stout straight saplings which he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves From these he would make the arms and legs and feet of his man For the body he stripped a sheet of thick 11 bark from around a big tree and with much labor fashioned it into a cylinder of about the right size pinning the edges together with wooden pegs Then whistling happily as he worked he carefully jointed the limbs and fastened them to the body with pegs whittled into shape with his knife By the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark and Tip remembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs So he picked up his wooden man and carried it back to the house with him During the evening by the light of the fire in the kitchen Tip carefully rounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough places in a neat and workmanlike manner Then he stood the figure up against the wall and admired it It seemed remarkably tall even for a fullgrown man but that was a good point in a small boys eyes and Tip did not object at all to the size of his creation Next morning when he looked at his work again Tip saw he had forgotten to give the dummy a neck by means of which he might fasten the pumpkinhead to the body So he went again to the forest which was not far away and chopped from a tree several pieces of wood with which to complete his work When he returned he fastened a crosspiece 12 to the upper end of the body making a hole through the center to hold upright the neck The bit of wood which formed this neck was also sharpened at the upper end and when all was ready Tip put on the pumpkin head pressing it well down onto the neck and found that it fitted very well The head could be turned to one side or the other as he pleased and the hinges of the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in any position he desired Now that declared Tip proudly is really a very fine man and it ought to frighten several screeches out of old Mombi But it would be much more lifelike if it were properly dressed To find clothing seemed no easy task but Tip boldly ransacked the great chest in which Mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures and at the very bottom he discovered some purple trousers a red shirt and a pink vest which was dotted with white spots These he carried away to his man and succeeded although the garments did not fit very well in dressing the creature in a jaunty fashion Some knit stockings belonging to Mombi and a much worn pair of his own shoes completed the mans apparel and Tip was so delighted that he danced up and down and laughed aloud in boyish ecstacy 13 I must give him a name he cried So good a man as this must surely have a name I believe he added after a moments thought I will name the fellow Jack Pumpkinhead LineArt Drawing 14 Full page lineart drawing 15 The Marvelous Powder of Life After considering the matter carefully Tip decided that the best place to locate Jack would be at the bend in the road a little way from the house So he started to carry his man there but found him heavy and rather awkward to handle After dragging the creature a short distance Tip stood him on his feet and by first bending the joints of one leg and then those of the other at the same time pushing from behind the boy managed to induce Jack to walk to the bend in the road It was not accomplished without a few tumbles and Tip really worked harder than he ever had in the fields or 16 forest but a love of mischief urged him on and it pleased him to test the cleverness of his workmanship Jacks all right and works fine he said to himself panting with the unusual exertion But just then he discovered the mans left arm had fallen off in the journey so he went back to find it and afterward by whittling a new and stouter pin for the shoulderjoint he repaired the injury so successfully that the arm was stronger than before Tip also noticed that Jacks pumpkin head had twisted around until it faced his back but this was easily remedied When at last the man was set up facing the turn in the path where old Mombi was to appear he looked natural enough to be a fair imitation of a Gillikin farmerand unnatural enough to startle anyone that came on him unawares As it was yet too early in the day to
