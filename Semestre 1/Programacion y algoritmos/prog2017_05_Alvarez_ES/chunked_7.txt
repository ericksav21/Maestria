is just the color for eyes I think Ill make the other a little bigger said the farmer And when the second eye was done I could see much better than before Then he made my nose and my mouth But I did not speak because at that time I didnt know what a mouth was for I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last I felt very proud for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone This fellow will scare the crows fast enough said the farmer He looks just like a man Why he is a man said the other and I quite agreed with him The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone I did not like to be deserted this way So I tried to walk after them But my feet would not touch the ground and I was forced to stay on that pole It was a lonely life to lead for I had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking I was a Munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person By and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted The other birds seeing he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me I felt sad at this for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all but the old crow comforted me saying If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them Brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man After the crows had gone I thought this over and decided I would try hard to get some brains By good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City I hope so said Dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them Oh yes I am anxious returned the Scarecrow It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool Well said the girl let us go And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow There were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled Toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick It was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest If this road goes in it must come out said the Scarecrow and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us Anyone would know that said Dorothy Certainly that is why I know it returned the Scarecrow If it required brains to figure it out I never should have said it After an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness Dorothy could not see at all but Toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well If you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark Soon after the Scarecrow stopped I see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches Shall we go there Yes indeed answered the child I am all tired out So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner She lay down at once and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep The Scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came 5 The Rescue of the Tin Woodman When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels She sat up and looked around her There was the Scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her We must go and search for water she said to him Why do you want water he asked To wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the Scarecrow thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink However you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast She saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for hersel
