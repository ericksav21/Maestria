r I had intended wishing that my head would never spoil Nonsense said the Scarecrow sharply If we could use the pills at all we would make far better wishes than that I do not see how anything could be better protested poor Jack If you were liable to spoil at any time you could understand my anxiety For my part said the Tin Woodman I sympathize with you in every respect But since we cannot count seventeen by twos sympathy is all you are liable to get By this time it had become quite dark and the voyagers found above them a cloudy sky through which the rays of the moon could not penetrate The Gump flew steadily on and for some reason the huge sofabody rocked more and more dizzily every hour The WoggleBug declared he was seasick and Tip was also pale and somewhat distressed But the others clung to the backs of the sofas and did not seem to mind the motion as long as they were not tipped out Darker and darker grew the night and on and on sped the Gump through the black heavens The 210 travelers could not even see one another and an oppressive silence settled down upon them After a long time Tip who had been thinking deeply spoke How are we to know when we come to the pallace of Glinda the Good he asked Its a long way to Glindas palace answered the Woodman Ive traveled it But how are we to know how fast the Gump is flying persisted the boy We cannot see a single thing down on the earth and before morning we may be far beyond the place we want to reach That is all true enough the Scarecrow replied a little uneasily But I do not see how we can stop just now for we might alight in a river or on the top of a steeple and that would be a great disaster So they permitted the Gump to fly on with regular flops of its great wings and waited patiently for morning Then Tips fears were proven to be well founded for with the first streaks of gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and discovered rolling plains dotted with queer villages where the houses instead of being dome shapedas they all are in the Land of Ozhad slanting roofs that rose to a peak 211 in the center Odd looking animals were also moving about upon the open plains and the country was unfamiliar to both the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow who had formerly visited Glinda the Goods domain and knew it well We are lost said the Scarecrow dolefully The Gump must have carried us entirely out of the Land of Oz and over the sandy deserts and into the terrible outside world that Dorothy told us about We must get back exclaimed the Tin Woodman earnestly we must get back as soon as possible Turn around cried Tip to the Gump turn as quickly as you can If I do I shall upset answered the Gump Im not at all used to flying and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place and then I can turn around and take a fresh start Just then however there seemed to be no stoppingplace that would answer their purpose They flew over a village so big that the WoggleBug declared it was a city and then they came to a range of high mountains with many deep gorges and steep cliffs showing plainly Now is our chance to stop said the boy finding 212 they were very close to the mountain tops Then he turned to the Gump and commanded Stop at the first level place you see Very well answered the Gump and settled down upon a table of rock that stood between two cliffs But not being experienced in such matters the Gump did not judge his speed correctly and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he missed it by half the width of his body breaking off both his right wings against the sharp edge of the rock and then tumbling over and over down the cliff Our friends held on to the sofas as long as they could but when the Gump caught on a proJecting rock the Thing stopped suddenlybottom side upand all were immediately dumped out By good fortune they fell only a few feet for underneath them was a monster nest built by a colony of Jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock so none of themnot even the Pumpkinheadwas injured by the fall For Jack found his precious head resting on the soft breast of the Scarecrow which made an excellent cushion and Tip fell on a mass of leaves and papers which saved him from injury The WoggleBug had bumped his round head against 213 Full page lineart drawing ALL WERE IMMEDIATELY DUMPED OUT 214 the SawHorse but without causing him more than a moments inconvenience The Tin Woodman was at first much alarmed but finding he had escaped without even a scratch upon his beautiful nickleplate he at once regained his accustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his comrades Our Journey had ended rather suddenly said he and we cannot justly blame our friend the Gump for our accident because he did the best he could under the circumstances But how we are ever to escape from this nest I must leave to someone with better brains than I possess Here he gazed at the Scarecrow who crawled to the edge of the nest and looked over Below them was a sheer precipice several hundred fe
