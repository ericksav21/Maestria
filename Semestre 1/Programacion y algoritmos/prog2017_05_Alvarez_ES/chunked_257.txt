e great twisting mass grew more and more menacing sending out its long curving bodies like arms to encircle them This thought Dorothy burying her head in Pigasus wing was black magic at its worst Now she could feel the clammy coils all around her and waited breathlessly to be crushed and broken But the cold heavy bodies seemed powerless and without weight and presently they too slipped away and vanished A shower of silver arrows followed the snakes and a cloud of choking green smoke the arrows But each blow on the crystal only seemed to prove further the potency of the kiss set on Dorothys forehead so long ago by the Good Witch of the North And because she clung so tightly to Pigasus he too came unharmed through the hairraising ordeal As they both almost afraid to breathe waited for the next blow on the dark crystal a long tremulous sigh came mournfully through the darkness It is no use murmured a discouraged voice my black magic is of no avail Come then destroy me if you must but do it quickly and I pray you will spare my people who have never harmed or hurt a living soul in Oz With a little thrill Dorothy recognized the voice of the Black Queen and as the dark lantern again shed its twinkling black rays over the circular apartment Gloma rose and came calmly and rapidly toward them Dorothy and Pigasus who had just had their own bravery so severely tested could not but admire the spirit and bravery of the Witch of the Black Forest Even though she was sure she faced certain destruction she walked proudly erect her head flung back her great mass of dusky hair billowing behind her Stop cried Dorothy on whom the Queens dark beauty had made a deep and lasting impression Why should we wish to destroy you We came through the Yellow Wood and from there into the Black Forest but we only wished to go through as quickly as possible We are in trouble ourselves Did you know that Ozma of Oz the Wizard of Oz the four rulers of Oz and many others have vanished There is a false Emperor on the throne in the Emerald City and under the magic of his enchantment all the people have forgotten Ozma ever was their Queen Pigasus and I escaping this enchantment are trying to find Ozma and someone to help us restore her to power Dorothy spoke with such earnestness and feeling Gloma could not help believing her ThenC4 then you did not come here to destroy me at all she exclaimed with an unhappy and embarrassed glance at her two prisoners Forgive me for using my magic powers I only wanted to save myself and my foresters from obliteration Oh thats all right Dorothy dismissed with a careless shrug the danger and discomfort of the last hour You thought we were going to destroy you so of course you tried to destroy us first That was fair enough and I dont blame you but now that we understand each other better perhaps you will help us Do you yourself remember Ozma and is your magic powerful enough to tell us where she is Seating herself in a chair near Dorothys footstool Gloma stared thoughtfully at the velvet carpet I know or remember nothing of the present history of Oz she told them after a short silence At the time the Wizard of Oz ruled Oz I ruled by royal right and inheritance the entire southern part of the Winkie Empire Although the Wicked Witch of the East claimed dominion over the whole country she only succeeded in bringing the central and northern parts under her control We in the South were free but when word came that a mortal girl had destroyed both the Witch of the East and the Witch of the West I being a witch naturally supposed I would be the next one to suffer destruction So calling together the strongest and most faithful of my subjects I begged them to retire with me to a safe and hidden spot where we could live in safety and tranquility far from the wars dangers and changing fortunes of the times Many of my Southern Winkies cast their lot with the new order marching off to the North but many came with me and retiring to this hidden forest we cut ourselves off from all intercourse with the other Kingdoms of Oz living the free and happy life of foresters and enjoying all the beauty and benefits of outdoor sport and activity Of the rulers in Oz since the Wizard I know nothing whatever And were you always black inquired Pigasus peering inquisitively up into Glomas face and wondering whether the two small black wings on each side of her forehead were as useful as his own No admitted the Queen smiling graciously down at her plump questioner That was part of our disappearing plan in a dark forest we were so much less likely to be found or discovered so with my knowledge of the black arts I turned myself and my subjects as black as you now see us What a shame What a pity Dorothy jumped up and perched cozily on the arm of the Black Queens chair If you had just come to the Emerald City we could have been friends all this while Why not begin now smiled the Queen putting her arm affectionately round Dorothys waist And you must not
