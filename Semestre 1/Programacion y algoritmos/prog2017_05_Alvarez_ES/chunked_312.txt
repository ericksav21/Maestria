ip beyond them in the fog but where as Samuel had demanded were her lights and crew Wildly Tandy hardly knowing what to think or do continued to blink into the maddening darkness Ato and Roger wakened by the horrible jolt now came hurrying out each waving a lantern Let go the anchor Mates ordered Samuel in a stern voice were to grips with an enemy ship so stand by for trouble Further shortening his sail Samuel waited tensely for the first move from their invisible foe Might be pirates he whispered out of the corner of his mouth to Tandy who stood close beside him grasping the scimitar that had once been Peters Jump the first man aboard How about a long shot in their general direction wheezed Ato who found the silence and suspense well nigh unbearable No it is not for us to start a fight stated Samuel grimly But hah Just let them start one Fetch me my stilts Roger and be quick about it too Stilts choked the Read Bird dropping the blunderbuss with which he had armed or rather winged himself Youll never be trying these things again they nearly shivered our timbers last time Why take another chance My stilts repeated Samuel savagely and Roger who knew his duty as a sailor flew without further argument to the hold When Roger returned with a stilt in each claw the Captain grasped one and moving silently as a cat over to the port rail he thrust the long pole experimentally out into the fog There was an instant thud and Samuel himself got a severe jolt as the stilt struck against some firm and immovable object beyond Convinced that it was an enemy ship Samuel returned to the others and drawn up in an anxious row the four shipmates waited for the fog to lift or the first enemy seaman to leap aboard Ill wager its a derelict or an abandoned vessel with no crew breathed Ato seating himself on a fire bucket to somewhat ease the long wait The first hour Tandy stood fairly well but the second seemed interminable The flickering lanterns the tense quiet the choking fog and gentle roll of the ship all made him desperately drowsy and much to his later disgust he must have finally fallen asleep The next thing he remembered was the shrill squall of the Read Bird and the pleasant feel of the sun on his eyelids The ship The pirates The fog thought Tandy springing up wildly But neither ship nor pirates met his astonished gaze Abaft the beam lay a great whispering deepsea forest its trees higher than the masts of the ship springing directly out of the water and stretching their leafy branches to the sky It was into one of these giant greenwoods the Crescent Moon had crashed in the fog Samuel was staring at the sea forest with the rapt look of a scientist who has just made an unbelievable discovery and Ato with his elbows resting on the rail was gazing dreamily in the same direction FF20Hoy Ahoy Why I never knew there were forests in the sea exclaimed Tandy running over to insinuate himself between the cook and the Captain There arent Its just plain impossible breathed Ato moving over to make room for Tandy But impossible or not there she lies And isnt it pretty he mused resting more than half of his great weight on the rail I suppose Sammyll want to dig up a sea tree and bring it along he leaned over to whisper mischievously in Tandys ear And anyway its better than pirates Look look theres fish in those trees screamed Roger bouncing up and down on Atos plump shoulder How about some flying fish for breakfast Cook dear Breakfast Breakfast Can it really be time for breakfast Ho hum I thought I was still asleep and dreaming grunted Ato giving himself a little shake Well forests or no forests a man must eat I suppose And still gazing delightedly over his shoulder the ships cook trod reluctantly toward the galley while Tandy hurried into the cabin for his paints CHAPTER 13 THE SEA FOREST Tandy had to call Samuel twice before he would come to breakfast and when he finally did sit down he was so busy preparing to explore the sea forest he ate scarcely a bite Well take the jolly boat he decided making long notes in his journal between his sips of coffee the small nets and knives and baskets for cuttings and any specimens we may pick up andFF20C4 Why the jolly boat when we have a jolly seagoing hippopotamus inquired Roger elevating one eyebrow A jolly hippopotamus I might add who runs under her own power and saves us the trouble of rowing Roger was much annoyed because he had failed to catch a flying fish before breakfast and instead of eating his hardboiled eggs kept winging over to the open port to glare at his finny rivals Tandy like the Captain was too excited to eat and even Ato downed his omelet and fresh strawberries from the Peakenspire fruit vine with rare speed and indifference Its a lucky thing youre so enormous Kobo puffed the ships cabin boy dropping down on the raft a few minutes later Atos got his crab nets and fishing lines Samuels bringing an aquarium a couple of baskets and a box And I have this pail my paints and a cage in
