was so terrible and unreal that he could not understand it at all and so had good reason to be afraid Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns and passed close beside them The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded There was no heat in the colored suns however and after they had passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again Weve got to come to the bottom some time remarked Zeb with a deep sigh We cant keep falling forever you know Of course not said Dorothy We are somewhere in the middle of the earth and the chances are well reach the other side of it before long But its a big hollow isnt it Awful big answered the boy Were coming to something now announced the horse At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked down Yes there was land below them and not so very far away either But they were floating very very slowlyso slowly that it could no longer be called a falland the children had ample time to take heart and look about them They saw a landscape with mountains and plains lakes and rivers very like those upon the earths surface but all the scene was splendidly colored by the variegated lights from the six suns Here and there were groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass because they sparkled so brightly Im sure we are in no danger said Dorothy in a sober voice We are falling so slowly that we cant be dashed to pieces when we land and this country that we are coming to seems quite pretty Well never get home again though declared Zeb with a groan Oh Im not so sure of that replied the girl But dont let us worry over such things Zeb we cant help ourselves just now you know and Ive always been told its foolish to borrow trouble The boy became silent having no reply to so sensible a speech and soon both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out below them They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a big city which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharppointed spires These spires were like great spearpoints and if they tumbled upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury Jim the horse had seen these spires also and his ears stood straight up with fear while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense But no they floated gently down upon a broad flat roof and came to a stop at last When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beasts legs trembled so much that he could hardly stand but Zeb at once leaped out of the buggy to the roof and he was so awkward and hasty that he kicked over Dorothys birdcage which rolled out upon the roof so that the bottom came off At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage sat down upon the glass roof and yawned and blinked its round eyes Oh said Dorothy Theres Eureka First time I ever saw a pink cat said Zeb Eureka isnt pink shes white Its this queer light that gives her that color Wheres my milk asked the kitten looking up into Dorothys face Im most starved to death Oh Eureka Can you talk Talk Am I talking Good gracious I believe I am Isnt it funny asked the kitten Its all wrong said Zeb gravely Animals ought not to talk But even old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident I cant see that its wrong remarked Jim in his gruff tones At least it isnt as wrong as some other things Whats going to become of us now I dont know answered the boy looking around him curiously The houses of the city were all made of glass so clear and transparent that one could look through the walls as easily as through a window Dorothy saw underneath the roof on which she stood several rooms used for rest chambers and even thought she could make out a number of queer forms huddled into the corners of these rooms The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it and pieces of glass were lying scattered in every direction A nearby steeple had been broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it Other buildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had happened to mar their perfection The rainbow tints from the colored suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many delicate shifting hues which were very pretty to see But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had arrived except that of their own voices They began to wonder if there were no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they were on and stepped into plain view He was not a very large man but was well formed and had a beautiful facecalm and serene as the face of a fine portrait His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green which varied as the sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the
