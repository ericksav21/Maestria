e me very much said the machine So she wound up Number Three and at once the copper man in a somewhat stiff and jerky fashion walked out of the rocky cavern took off his copper hat and bowed politely and then kneeled before Dorothy Said he From this time forth I am your obedient servant Whatever you command that I will do willinglyif you keep me wound up What is your name she asked Tiktok he replied My former master gave me that name because my clockwork always ticks when it is wound up I can hear it now said the yellow hen So can I said Dorothy And then she added with some anxiety You dont strike do you No answered Tiktok and there is no alarm connected with my machinery I can tell the time though by speaking and as I never sleep I can waken you at any hour you wish to get up in the morning Thats nice said the little girl only I never wish to get up in the morning You can sleep until I lay my egg said the yellow hen Then when I cackle Tiktok will know it is time to waken you Do you lay your egg very early asked Dorothy About eight oclock said Billina And everybody ought to be up by that time Im sure 5 Dorothy Opens the Dinner Pail Now Tiktok said Dorothy the first thing to be done is to find a way for us to escape from these rocks The Wheelers are down below you know and threaten to kill us There is no reason to be afraid of the Wheelers said Tiktok the words coming more slowly than before Why not she asked Because they are aggggrgrrr He gave a sort of gurgle and stopped short waving his hands frantically until suddenly he became motionless with one arm in the air and the other held stiffly before him with all the copper fingers of the hand spread out like a fan Dear me said Dorothy in a frightened tone What can the matter be Hes run down I suppose said the hen calmly You couldnt have wound him up very tight I didnt know how much to wind him replied the girl but Ill try to do better next time She ran around the copper man to take the key from the peg at the back of his neck but it was not there Its gone cried Dorothy in dismay Whats gone asked Billina The key It probably fell off when he made that low bow to you returned the hen Look around and see if you cannot find it again Dorothy looked and the hen helped her and by and by the girl discovered the clockkey which had fallen into a crack of the rock At once she wound up Tiktoks voice taking care to give the key as many turns as it would go around She found this quite a task as you may imagine if you have ever tried to wind a clock but the machine mans first words were to assure Dorothy that he would now run for at least twentyfour hours You did not wind me much at first he calmly said and I told you that long story about King Evoldo so it is no wonder that I ran down She next rewound the action clockwork and then Billina advised her to carry the key to Tiktok in her pocket so it would not get lost again And now said Dorothy when all this was accomplished tell me what you were going to say about the Wheelers Why they are nothing to be frightend at said the machine They try to make folks believe that they are very terrible but as a matter of fact the Wheelers are harmless enough to any one that dares to fight them They might try to hurt a little girl like you perhaps because they are very mischievous But if I had a club they would run away as soon as they saw me Havent you a club asked Dorothy No said Tiktok And you wont find such a thing among these rocks either declared the yellow hen Then what shall we do asked the girl Wind up my thinkworks tightly and I will try to think of some other plan said Tiktok So Dorothy rewound his thought machinery and while he was thinking she decided to eat her dinner Billina was already pecking away at the cracks in the rocks to find something to eat so Dorothy sat down and opened her tin dinnerpail In the cover she found a small tank that was full of very nice lemonade It was covered by a cup which might also when removed be used to drink the lemonade from Within the pail were three slices of turkey two slices of cold tongue some lobster salad four slices of bread and butter a small custard pie an orange and nine large strawberries and some nuts and raisins Singularly enough the nuts in this dinnerpail grew already cracked so that Dorothy had no trouble in picking out their meats to eat She spread the feast upon the rock beside her and began her dinner first offering some of it to Tiktok who declined because as he said he was merely a machine Afterward she offered to share with Billina but the hen murmured something about dead things and said she preferred her bugs and ants Do the lunchbox trees and the dinnerpail trees belong to the Wheelers the child asked Tiktok while engaged in eating her meal Of course not he answered They belong to the royal family of Ev only of course there is no royal family just now because King Evoldo jumped into the sea and his wife and ten children have been transformed by the Nome King So the
