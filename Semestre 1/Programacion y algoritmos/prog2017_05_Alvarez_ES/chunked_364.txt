ouve seen a bit of the capital Oh Handy wouldnt leave us snorted the royal Ox moving as close to the Goat Girl as he could get We couldnt get along without Handy Mandy your Majesty Oh please let her stay in Keretaria begged the little King adding his voice to that of his Royal Ox You will live with us in the palace wont you Handy Well if I just had my goatsFF20C4 considered the sevenarmed maiden Mt Mern would seem rather dull after Oz she acknowledged pensively But what about that old King whos still on Kerrys throne and what am I to do with this silver hammer and what do you suppose Himself has done with Wutz and Ruggedo Yes whats to be done with Wutz echoed the Scarecrow wrinkling up his cotton forehead And now the little sitting room began fairly to buzz with excited questions and suggestions for there was still a lot to be explained and settled The Ozites could hardly keep their eyes off the sevenarmed Goat Girl the handsome young ruler of Keretaria and his Royal Ox Dorothy longed to unscrew his horn and test its magic power for herself but Ozma anxious to repair all the damage done by the wicked wizard now raised her scepter for silence Clasping on the Gnome Kings belt Ozma first brought back her magic picture and with a quick wish returned Glindas book of records to her castle in the South Next though she knew neither the extent nor the nature of the wizards other thefts she caused to be restored to their rightful owners all the magic appliances in the Silver Kings den The Scarecrow had already reported the stupefied condition of the other occupants of the palace so Ozmas next thought was to restore them to their accustomed selves No sooner was the Cowardly Lion released than he crawled under a table but the Hungry Tiger rushed out on the balcony growling and lashing his tail as he thought of the indignity he had suffered After a short conference with Handy Mandy Ozma freed all the potted prisoners of the wicked wizard and made Nifflepok King of the Silver Mountain She moved the cliff dwellings of the people to the outside of the mountain so Wutzs pale subjects could enjoy with the rest of the Gillikins the bright sunshine and beneficent climate of Oz The Magic Mountain itself with all its dark pits and jeweled caverns Ozma sealed up tightly and forever The wizards agents were turned to moles for they were already more like these boring little animals than men After each magic wish or transformation the little group in the royal sitting room would look in the magic picture which Ozma had immediately repaired And in each case Handy felt that the ruler of Oz had used both wisdom and good judgment Nox as they were watching the wizards agents turn to moles gave a snort of surprise for the first figure shown was old King Kerr who was really Number Nine As the wicked imposter changed quickly from a man to a mole and scurried off the throne and away to bury himself in the blue forest Nox and Handy both heaved a sigh of relief and satisfaction While Ozma was working on the magic safe Handy deciding to try a little of her own magic softly tapped the silver hammer on the arm of her chair At once to the delight and interest of everyone Himself the elf appeared astride the arm holding a small cactus plant in each hand I wish you in the future to obey the summons of her Majesty Ozma of Oz smiled the Goat Girl placing the silver hammer as she spoke in Ozmas lap This young fairy is more experienced in magic than I and will know to use the hammer to best advantage Oh all right But I rather liked working for you grinned Himself And say I tried to turn these rascals to plants but this was the best I could do Setting the two pots of cactus down on a small writing desk the hammer elf bowed first to Handy and then to Ozma Wait Dont go begged the little Fairy as Himself showed unmistakable signs of disappearing Do tell us about this silver hammer and who owned it first It belonged to Wunchie a witch of the West whos lived in the Munchkin Mountains for about a thousand years and used it to control as many of the Munchkin Kings as she could explained the dwarf balancing himself cleverly on an inkwell Then I suppose Wunchie was responsible for the prophecy in Keretaria surmised Nox blinking his eyes at the hammer elf The dwarf nodded cheerfully Yes Wunchie invented that prophecy he told them and placed her own white oxen in the country Each time she had trouble forcing the King to do as she wished she tapped him and the ox on the head with her hammer But I took rather a fancy to you admitted Himself looking fondly at Nox So when she ordered me to tap you off and traded the little King Kerry to Wutz for a basket of jumping beans and put Wutzs agent on the throne of Keretaria I decided to take a hand myself So I gave you only a light tap and at the same time I stored enough magic in your horns to help you find Kerry C4 and with the help of this handy Goat Girl you DID find him beamed the hammer elf I knew my magic was good You
