ants waited upon the strangers from Oz and did everything in their power to make the party comfortable There were many vacant rooms at their disposal and the brave Army of twentyseven was easily provided for and liberally feasted The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were unharnessed from the chariot and allowed to roam at will throughout the palace where they nearly frightened the servants into fits although they did no harm at all At one time Dorothy found the little maid Nanda crouching in terror in a corner with the Hungry Tiger standing before her You certainly look delicious the beast was saying Will you kindly give me permission to eat you No no no cried the maid in reply Then said the Tiger yawning frightfully please to get me about thirty pounds of tenderloin steak cooked rare with a peck of boiled potatoes on the side and five gallons of icecream for dessert IIll do the best I can said Nanda and she ran away as fast as she could go Are you so very hungry asked Dorothy in wonder You can hardly imagine the size of my appetite replied the Tiger sadly It seems to fill my whole body from the end of my throat to the tip of my tail I am very sure the appetite doesnt fit me and is too large for the size of my body Some day when I meet a dentist with a pair of forceps Im going to have it pulled What your tooth asked Dorothy No my appetite said the Hungry Tiger The little girl spent most of the afternoon talking with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman who related to her all that had taken place in the Land of Oz since Dorothy had left it She was much interested in the story of Ozma who had been when a baby stolen by a wicked old witch and transformed into a boy She did not know that she had ever been a girl until she was restored to her natural form by a kind sorceress Then it was found that she was the only child of the former Ruler of Oz and was entitled to rule in his place Ozma had many adventures however before she regained her fathers throne and in these she was accompanied by a pumpkinheaded man a highly magnified and thoroughly educated WoggleBug and a wonderful sawhorse that had been brought to life by means of a magic powder The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had also assisted her but the Cowardly Lion who ruled the great forest as the King of Beasts knew nothing of Ozma until after she became the reigning princess of Oz Then he journeyed to the Emerald City to see her and on hearing she was about to visit the Land of Ev to set free the royal family of that country the Cowardly Lion begged to go with her and brought along his friend the Hungry Tiger as well Having heard this story Dorothy related to them her own adventures and then went out with her friends to find the Sawhorse which Ozma had caused to be shod with plates of gold so that its legs would not wear out They came upon the Sawhorse standing motionless beside the garden gate but when Dorothy was introduced to him he bowed politely and blinked his eyes which were knots of wood and wagged his tail which was only the branch of a tree What a remarkable thing to be alive exclaimed Dorothy I quite agree with you replied the Sawhorse in a rough but not unpleasant voice A creature like me has no business to live as we all know But it was the magic powder that did it so I cannot justly be blamed Of course not said Dorothy And you seem to be of some use cause I noticed the Scarecrow riding upon your back Oh yes Im of use returned the Sawhorse and I never tire never have to be fed or cared for in any way Are you intelgent asked the girl Not very said the creature It would be foolish to waste intelligence on a common Sawhorse when so many professors need it But I know enough to obey my masters and to giddup or whoa when Im told to So Im pretty well satisfied That night Dorothy slept in a pleasant little bedchamber next to that occupied by Ozma of Oz and Billina perched upon the foot of the bed and tucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly in that position as did Dorothy upon her soft cushions But before daybreak every one was awake and stirring and soon the adventurers were eating a hasty breakfast in the great diningroom of the palace Ozma sat at the head of a long table on a raised platform with Dorothy on her right hand and the Scarecrow on her left The Scarecrow did not eat of course but Ozma placed him near her so that she might ask his advice about the journey while she ate Lower down the table were the twentyseven warriors of Oz and at the end of the room the Lion and the Tiger were eating out of a kettle that had been placed upon the floor while Billina fluttered around to pick up any scraps that might be scattered It did not take long to finish the meal and then the Lion and the Tiger were harnessed to the chariot and the party was ready to start for the Nome Kings Palace First rode Ozma with Dorothy beside her in the golden chariot and holding Billina fast in her arms Then came the Scarecrow on the Sawhorse with the Tin Woodman an
