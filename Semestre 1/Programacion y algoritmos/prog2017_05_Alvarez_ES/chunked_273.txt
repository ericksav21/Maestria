and held by trickery my friends and we are here to see that those necklaces are returned and the Kingdom of Oz restored to its proper rulers And suppose we refuse suggested the white horse in a bored voice What then Why then Bitty Bit threw back his shoulders and spun round several times on his shiny stool why then it means WAR Bitty Bit did not say who were his friends or allies or where he should get his armies but he spoke with such firm confidence both Skamperoo and Chalk were taken aback and completely dismayed Matiah had been bad enough but this strange and determined little Seer was worse Perhaps we can make a bargain or come to some agreement suggested Chalk resolved to save what he could for himself and his Master Suppose King Skamperoo and I agree to return the emerald necklaces which undoubtedly belong in Oz will you grant us the privilege of using them twice for ourselves But C4 but C4 Skamperoo was about to blurt out the fact that they no longer had the necklaces when Chalk gave him a savage nip on the leg which silenced him effectively Why should we do that inquired Pigasus fluttering his wings nervously After all the grief and worry you have caused us you are lucky to get off with your skins Where are the necklaces now asked Dorothy stepping close to Chalk and looking eagerly up into the face of the discomfited Emperor Skamperoos face grew long as a balloon suddenly punctured but remembering Chalks last bite he managed to keep silent When you have answered OUR question we will answer yours stated Chalk firmly but pleasantly You can of course appeal to the Court and members of the household but I think you will find them entirely satisfied with their present Emperor and ready to stand by him to the last man At Chalks words Bitty Bit looked rather crestfallen As the white horse had so quietly stated they were perfectly powerless to take the necklaces by force and quick inspection of the Emperor when he first reached the palace had convinced him Skamperoo was not wearing the precious emeralds At this rather embarrassing moment a series of thumps kicks and knocks on the door made not only the rescuers but the Emperor and Chalk turn rather pale Oh Oh Its Matiah quavered Skamperoo whose nerves were completely shaken by the shocking disclosures of the last few moments Oh Oh Whatll we do now Hold your tongue advised Chalk and swinging round he trotted briskly over to the door Whos there he demanded in a dignified voice FF20Tis I C4 Iva the Kitchen Boy stuttered a frightened treble I must see the Emperor at once Well shall we let him in Bitty Bit looked uneasily at Pigasus and Dorothy and then rather thoughtfully at Chalk Suit yourselves yawned the white horse indifferently Its probably a messenger telling us the pudding is cold with all this delay and darkness You asked for an hours time and conversation and we agreed to that demand so it is for you to decide what to do not us Oh let him in fumed Pigasus and tell him to stop this hammering and yammering What harm is there in a Kitchen Boy So Bitty Bit taking the key from the lock and squinting through the keyhole to assure himself there was only a small boy outside quickly admitted him Now in darted Iva screaming loudly of a madman in the cellar and bursting into tearful and incoherent recital of his woes Scarcely had he got out two sentences before Skamperoo fell bodily off his horse and made a desperate snatch at the Kitchen Boys throat But Bitty Bit was too quick for him His eyes too had caught the glimmer of emeralds and jerking the three chains from the lads neck as Chalk made a savage lunge forward he tossed them to Pigasus Catching them on his nose as cleverly as a trained seal the pink pig spread his wings and flew up to the top of a tall cabinet where he sat panting and puffing with satisfaction and defiance Come down you fat scoundrel roared Skamperoo dancing up and down like a dervish while the poor Kitchen Boy outraged by the way both Skamperoo and Bitty Bit had rushed upon him burst into loud sobs and rushing out the still open door ran crying down the corridor Slamming the door and locking it after him Bitty Bit rather anxiously waited for Chalks next move and as usual Chalk was quite prepared and ready to make it Well he observed with a jaunty flick of his tail now that you have the famous wishing emeralds I suppose you are satisfied and we may as well go Come along Skamperoo you will get nowhere in an argument with a pig Just casting pearls before swine you know and he already has our emeralds You mean your wishing necklaces shrieked Pigasus furiously And Ill tell you what I wish I wish that you and your silly Master were clams at the bottom of the Nonestic Ocean Thoroughly shocked and startled by the pink pigs unexpected wish Bitty Bit and Dorothy rushed toward the cabinet hoping in some way to prevent the wish from taking effect But they need not have worried for of course nothing happened at all Then Skamperoo urged by Chalk hastil
