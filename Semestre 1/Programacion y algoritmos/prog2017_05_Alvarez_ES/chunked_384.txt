her clothes and everywhere you go Certainly Chillywalla nodded vigorously Do you suppose we want to stand around and disintegrate What happens to articles after they are taken out of their boxes he demanded argumentatively Tell me that Why said Randy thoughtfully theyre worn or sold or eaten or spoiledC4 Exactly Chillywalla snapped him up quickly They are worn out they lose their freshness and their newness Well we intend to save ourselves from such a fate and we do he added complacently Youre certainly fresh enough chuckled Kabumpo with a wink at Randy But might not these boxes be fun to wear inquired Planetty looking rather wistfully at the bright heap the Boxer Chief had intended for her No No and NO rumbled Kabumpo positively No boxes As you wish Chillywalla shrugged his shoulders under his cardboard clothes box Shall I unbox the horse Better not decided Randy looking anxiously at the sparks issuing from the punctures in Thuns box But perhaps you would show us the way through this thisC4 Box Wood finished Chillywalla Yes I will be most honored to conduct you through our forest And you may pick as many boxes as you wish too he added generously Id like to do something for people who are so soon to spoil and wither Ha ha Now Im sure thats very kind of you roared Kabumpo wiping his eyes on the fringe of his robe And I think it best we hurry along my good fellow Ho whither away It would never do to have a spoiled King and Princess and a bad horse and elephant on your hands Oh if youd ONLY wear our boxes begged Chillywalla almost ready to cry at the prospect of his visitors spoiling on the premises Then as Kabumpo shook his head again the Big Boxer started off at a rapid shuffle anxious to have them out of the woods as soon as possible Thun during all this conversation had been kicking and bucking under his iron box but now Planetty tapped out a reassuring message with her staff and the Thunder Colt quieted down On the whole he behaved rather well following the signals his little mistress tapped out and pushing the iron box along without too much discomfort or complaint though occasional indignant and fiery protests came puffing out of his iron container Randy considered the journey through the Box Wood one of their gayest and most entertaining adventures The woodmen in their brightly decorated boxes shuffled cheerfully along beside them stopping now and then to point with pride to their square boxlike dwellings set at regular intervals under the spreading boxwood trees The whole forest was covered by an enormous wooden box that shut out the sky and gave everything an artificial and unreal look It was in one side of this monster box that Thun had burned the hole to admit them Randy and Planetty riding sociably together on Kabumpos back picked boxes from branches of all the trees they could reach and it was such fun and so exciting they paid scarcely any attention to the remarks of Chillywalla Even the Elegant Elephant snapped off a box or two and handed them back to his royal riders Oh look exulted Randy opening a bright blue cardboard box This is just full of chocolate candy Oh throw that trash away advised Chillywalla contemptuously We think nothing of the stuff that grows inside its the boxes themselves we are after But this candy is good objected Randy after sampling several pieces And mind you Kabumpo Planetty has just picked a jewel box full of real chains rings and bracelets Oh they are netiful netiful crooned the Princess of Anuther Planet hugging the velvet jewel box to her breast Keep them if you wish sniffed Chillywalla but theyre just rubbish to us When we pick boxes we toss the contents away Now thats just plain foolishness snorted Kabumpo aghast at such a waste as Randy picked a pencil box full of neatly sharpened pencils and Planetty a tidy sewing kit fitted out with scissors needles and spools of thread The thimble was not quite ripe but as Planetty had never stitched a stitch in her royal life she did not notice or care about that Indeed before they came to the other side of the Box Wood she and Randy were sitting in the midst of a high heap of their treasures and Kabumpo looked as if he were making a lengthy safari loaded up and down for the journey Randy had stuffed most of the boxes into big net bags Kabumpo always brought along for emergencies and these he tied to the Elegant Elephants harness There were bread boxes packed with tiny loaves and biscuits cake boxes stuffed with sugar buns and cookies stamp boxes flower boxes glove boxes coat and suit boxes Last of all Randy picked a Band Box and it played such gay tunes when he lifted the lid Planetty clapped her silver hands and even Kabumpo began to hum under his breath Traveling through the Box Wood with kindhearted Chillywalla was more like a surprise party than anything else To Planetty it was all so delightful she began to wonder how she had ever been satisfied with her life on Anuther Planet Are all the countries down here as differe
