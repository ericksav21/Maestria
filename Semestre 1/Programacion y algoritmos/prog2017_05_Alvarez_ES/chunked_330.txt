CHAPTER 1 MANDY LEAVES THE MOUNTAIN WhataButter WhataButter High and clear above the peaks of Mt Mern floated the voice of the Goat Girl calling the finest fattest but most troublesome of her flock All the other goats were winding obediently down toward the village that perched precariously on the edge of the mountain But of WhataButter there was not a single sign or whisker Serves me right for spoiling the contrary creature panted Mandy pushing back her thick yellow braids with her secondbest hand Always wants her own way that goat so she does WhataButter I say WHATABUTTER come down here this instant But only the tantalizing tinkle of the goats silver bell came to answer her for WhataButter was climbing up not down and there was nothing for Mandy to do but go after her Muttering dire threats which she was much too softhearted ever to carry out the rosycheeked mountain lass scrambled over crags and stones pulling herself up steep precipices the goat always managing to keep a few jumps ahead till soon they were almost at the top of the mountain Here stepping on a jutting rock to catch her breath and remove the burrs from her stockings Mandy heard a dreadful roar and felt an ominous rumbling beneath her feet WhataButter on a narrow ledge just above heard it too and cocked her head anxiously on one side Perhaps she had best jump down to Mandy After all the great silly girl did feed and pet her and from the sound of things a storm was brewing If there was one thing the goat feared more than another it was a thunderstorm so rolling her eyes as innocently as if she had not dragged Mandy all over the mountain she stretched her nose down toward her weary mistress BahC4ahahahhhhhhhhhh bleated WhataButter affectionately Oh Bah yourself fumed Mandy making an angry snatch for the Nanny Goats beard Pets and children are all alike never appreciate a body till they have a stomach ache or a thunderstorm is coming Now then mlass be quick with you Holding out her strong arms Mandy made ready to catch the goat as it jumped off the ledge But before WhataButter could stir there was a perfectly awful crash and explosion and up shot the slab of rock on which Mandy was standing up UP and out of sight entirely Where the mountain girl had been a crystal column of water spurted viciously into the air so high the bulging eyes of the goat could see no end to it Rearing up on her hind legs WhataButter turned round and round in a frantic effort to catch a glimpse of her vanishing Mistress Then thinking suddenly what would happen should the torrent turn and fall upon her the goat sprang off the ledge and ran madly down the mountain bleating like a whole herd of Banshees And Mandy as you can well believe was as frightened as WhataButter and with twice as much reason The first upheaval as the rock left the earth flung her flat on her nose Grasping the edges of the slab with all hands Mandy hung on for dear life and as a stinging shower of icy water sprayed her from head to foot wondered what under the earth was happening to her Thorns and thistles Could the thunderstorm really have come UP instead of down Certainly it was raining up and whatever was carrying her aloft with such terrible force and relentlessness How could the Goat Girl know that a turbulent spring pent up for thousands of years in the center of Mt Mern had suddenly burst its way to freedom And you have no idea of the tremendous power in a mountain spring once it uncoils and lets itself go Mandys rock might just as well have been shot into the air by a magic cannon First it tore upward as if it meant to knock a hole in the sky then still traveling at incalculable speed began to arch and take a horizontal course over the mountains hills and valleys west of Mern All poor Mandy knew was that she was hurtling through space at breakneck speed with nothing to save or stop her The long yellow braids of the Goat Girl streamed out like pennants while her striped skirt and voluminous petticoats snapped and fluttered like banners in the wind WhataButter Oh WhataButter moaned Mandy gazing wildly over the edge of the rock But pshaw what was the use of calling WhataButter even if she heard could not fly after her through the air and when she herself came down not even her own goat would recognize her At this depressing thought Mandy dropped her head on her arms and began to weep bitterly for she was quite sure she would never see her friends her home or her goats again But the strength and frugal life on Mt Mern had made the Goat Girl both brave and resourceful so she soon dried her tears and as the rock still showed no signs of slowing up or dashing down she began to take heart and even a desperate sort of interest in her experience Slowly and cautiously she pulled herself to a sitting position and still clutching the edges of the rock dared to look down at the countries and towns flashing away below After all sniffed the reckless maiden nothing very dreadful has happened yet Ive always w
