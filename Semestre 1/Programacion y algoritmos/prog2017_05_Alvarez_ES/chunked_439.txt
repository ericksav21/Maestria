atient he told the Scarecrow earnestly Im hurrying just as fast as ever I can But what do you propose to do demanded the Scarecrow puckering his forehead into almost forty deep wrinkles Cant you whiz these Stratovanians away or send them back where they came from Not without Ozmas magic belt sighed the Wizard And you know perfectly well that the belt is back in the Emerald City safe in the castle Then cant you transport the safe here asked the Scarecrow playing a frantic little tune on the edge of the table Just what Im trying to do admitted the Wizard turning a lever here and a wheel there But this tripleedged zentomatic transporter of Glindas does not seem to be working as it should Ill probably be able to fix it in a little while but meantime I tell you what you can do Post yourself beside the record book and the minute it announces Struts arrival in the Emerald City rush straight back here to me Before he had finished his sentence the Scarecrow was gone and for the next two hours the faithful Straw Man without once lifting his eyes bent over the great book of records reading with tense interest and lively appreciation of the progress of the Oztober and the Airlanders toward the Capitol of Oz CHAPTER 18 STRUT OF THE STRAT ARRIVES IN OZ For several hours after leaving Stratovania Nick followed the Wizards map implicitly With Strut leaning over the back of his seat eyes glued to both map and board there was nothing else he could do If he deviated from the course so much as a hairs breadth the Airlander would tap him on his tin head with his staff The Tin Woodman had not expected Strut to be so clever about navigating and as time passed he grew less and less hopeful of outwitting the wily Airman If he increased the speed of the Oztober in an effort to outdistance Struts flying warriors they also increased their speed Try as he would it seemed quite impossible to lose them But Nick Chopper did not despair He was counting on the night to help him Never tiring or needing sleep he would have the advantage of Strut then As soon as the Airlander relaxed in his seat the Tin Woodman meant to fall upon him hurl him from a window put all the planes lights out and speed off in the dark so swiftly the Stratovanians would be unable to follow That failing he depended on the difference in altitude to subdue the enemy Perhaps when they reached the lower areas Strut and his Airmen would faint wilt and become harmless So bolstering his spirits with these heartening hopes Nick bore as patiently as he could the long afternoon and the unpleasant taunts and company of his captor Repassing the ice crescent without meeting any Spikers the Tin Woodman zoomed along not even bothering to answer Struts many questions about Oz and its inhabitants Night when it did come was especially dark and murky No moon and only a few stars dotted the arching Skyway The darker the better rejoiced the Tin Woodman taking quick little glances over his shoulder to see whether Strut was falling asleep or showing any signs of drowsiness If it were just dark enough hed rid himself of these flying pests in a hurry But all his plans proved futile As the Oztober rushed on and on and the hours dragged slowly by Strut grew even more alert and watchful His starshaped eyes twinkled and glowed with sulphurous lights and he showed no more signs of weariness than the Tin Woodman himself The endurance of the Airlander and his warriors was positively uncanny and Nick maneuvering the buttons and wheel of the plane grew increasingly discouraged and gloomy Flying at this rate they would arrive in the Emerald City early in the morning and to think that he was leading this band of savages upon the defenseless City almost broke Nick Choppers heart As it was a red plush heart it could not really break but it fluttered up and down in his tin bosom like a bird beating against the bars of a cage To Nicks suggestion that he rest Strut gave a contemptuous glance Ill rest in Ohsmas palace he sneered maliciously Dye think I trust you enough to sleep Ho no Just attend to your flying Mr Funnel Top and Ill take care of the rest of this little adventure After this Nick made no further remarks and morning found the Oztober sailing high above the Hammerhead Mountains in the Quadling Country of Oz All too soon the Tin Woodman made out the glittering green turrets and spires of the Emerald City itself Quite a pretty little town observed Strut condescendingly as Nick his thoughts in a perfect tumult tried to think of some excuse for not landing Why are you not flying over the castle demanded Strut sharply Its the castle I am most anxious to reach There you can come down right inside the walls My My So this is the wonderful Land of OHS Well it owes me its crown jewels and treasure to pay for your insolent invasion of the Strat Collecting them should prove pleasant Very pleasant indeed I wouldnt be too sure of that snapped Nick turning his head stiffly I suppose you realize you are in great d
