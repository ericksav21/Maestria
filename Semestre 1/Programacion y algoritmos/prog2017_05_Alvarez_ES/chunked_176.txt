n the Tiger and the Lion were sumptuously fed and Jim the Cabhorse ate his oatmeal out of a golden bowl with seven rows of rubies sapphires and diamonds set around the rim of it In the afternoon they all went to a great field outside the city gates where the games were to be held There was a beautiful canopy for Ozma and her guests to sit under and watch the people run races and jump and wrestle You may be sure the folks of Oz did their best with such a distinguished company watching them and finally Zeb offered to wrestle with a little Munchkin who seemed to be the champion In appearance he was twice as old as Zeb for he had long pointed whiskers and wore a peaked hat with little bells all around the brim of it which tinkled gaily as he moved But although the Munchkin was hardly tall enough to come to Zebs shoulder he was so strong and clever that he laid the boy three times on his back with apparent ease Zeb was greatly astonished at his defeat and when the pretty Princess joined her people in laughing at him he proposed a boxingmatch with the Munchkin to which the little Ozite readily agreed But the first time that Zeb managed to give him a sharp box on the ears the Munchkin sat down upon the ground and cried until the tears ran down his whiskers because he had been hurt This made Zeb laugh in turn and the boy felt comforted to find that Ozma laughed as merrily at her weeping subject as she had at him Just then the Scarecrow proposed a race between the Sawhorse and the Cabhorse and although all the others were delighted at the suggestion the Sawhorse drew back saying Such a race would not be fair Of course not added Jim with a touch of scorn those little wooden legs of yours are not half as long as my own It isnt that said the Sawhorse modestly but I never tire and you do Bah cried Jim looking with great disdain at the other do you imagine for an instant that such a shabby imitation of a horse as you are can run as fast as I I dont know Im sure replied the Sawhorse That is what we are trying to find out remarked the Scarecrow The object of a race is to see who can win itor at least that is what my excellent brains think Once when I was young said Jim I was a race horse and defeated all who dared run against me I was born in Kentucky you know where all the best and most aristocratic horses come from But youre old now Jim suggested Zeb Old Why I feel like a colt today replied Jim I only wish there was a real horse here for me to race with Id show the people a fine sight I can tell you Then why not race with the Sawhorse enquired the Scarecrow Hes afraid said Jim Oh no answered the Sawhorse I merely said it wasnt fair But if my friend the Real Horse is willing to undertake the race I am quite ready So they unharnessed Jim and took the saddle off the Sawhorse and the two queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start When I say Go Zeb called to them you must dig out and race until you reach those three trees you see over yonder Then circle round them and come back again The first one that passes the place where the Princess sits shall be named the winner Are you ready I suppose I ought to give the wooden dummy a good start of me growled Jim Never mind that said the Sawhorse Ill do the best I can Go cried Zeb and at the word the two horses leaped forward and the race was begun Jims big hoofs pounded away at a great rate and although he did not look very graceful he ran in a way to do credit to his Kentucky breeding But the Sawhorse was swifter than the wind Its wooden legs moved so fast that their twinkling could scarcely be seen and although so much smaller than the cabhorse it covered the ground much faster Before they had reached the trees the Sawhorse was far ahead and the wooden animal returned to the starting place as was being lustily cheered by the Ozites before Jim came panting up to the canopy where the Princess and her friends were seated I am sorry to record the fact that Jim was not only ashamed of his defeat but for a moment lost control of his temper As he looked at the comical face of the Sawhorse he imagined that the creature was laughing at him so in a fit of unreasonable anger he turned around and made a vicious kick that sent his rival tumbling head over heels upon the ground and broke off one of its legs and its left ear An instant later the Tiger crouched and launched its huge body through the air swift and resistless as a ball from a cannon The beast struck Jim full on his shoulder and sent the astonished cabhorse rolling over and over amid shouts of delight from the spectators who had been horrified by the ungracious act he had been guilty of When Jim came to himself and sat upon his haunches he found the Cowardly Lion crouched on one side of him and the Hungry Tiger on the other and their eyes were glowing like balls of fire I beg your pardon Im sure said Jim meekly I was wrong to kick the Sawhorse and I am sorry I became angry at him He has won the race and won it fair
