at his friend Jack The wooden body with its gorgeous clothing 111 still sat upright upon the horses back but the pumpkin head was gone and only the sharpened stick that served for a neck was visible As for the Scarecrow the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed itself into his legs and the lower part of his bodywhich appeared very plump and round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack Upon his head the Scarecrow still wore the heavy crown which had been sewed on to prevent his losing it but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly like a Japanese pug dog Tip would have laughedhad he not been so anxious about his man Jack But the Scarecrow however damaged was all there while the pumpkin head that was so necessary to Jacks existence was missing so the boy seized a long pole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously turned again toward the river Far out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin which gently bobbed up and down with the motion of the waves At that moment it was quite out of Tips reach but after a time it floated nearer and still nearer until the boy 112 Full page lineart drawing TIP RESCUES JACKS PUMPKIN HEAD 113 was able to reach it with his pole and draw it to the shore Then he brought it to the top of the bank carefully wiped the water from its pumpkin face with his handkerchief and ran with it to Jack and replaced the head upon the mans neck Dear me were Jacks first words What a dreadful experience I wonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins Tip did not think a reply was necessary for he knew that the Scarecrow also stood in need of his help So he carefully removed the straw from the Kings body and legs and spread it out in the sun to dry The wet clothing he hung over the body of the SawHorse If water spoils pumpkins observed Jack with a deep sigh then my days are numbered Ive never noticed that water spoils pumpkins returned Tip unless the water happens to be boiling If your head isnt cracked my friend you must be in fairly good condition Oh my head isnt cracked in the least declared Jack more cheerfully Then dont worry retorted the boy Care once killed a cat Then said Jack seriously I am very glad indeed that I am not a cat 114 The sun was fast drying their clothing and Tip stirred up his Majestys straw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and make it as crisp and dry as ever When this had been accomplished he stuffed the Scarecrow into symmetrical shape and smoothed out his face so that he wore his usual gay and charming expression Thank you very much said the monarch brightly as he walked about and found himself to be well balanced There are several distinct advantages in being a Scarecrow For if one has friends near at hand to repair damages nothing very serious can happen to you I wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins said Jack with an anxious ring in his voice Not at allnot at all replied the Scarecrow gaily All you need fear my boy is old age When your golden youth has decayed we shall quickly part companybut you neednt look forward to it well discover the fact ourselves and notify you But come Let us resume our journey I am anxious to greet my friend the Tin Woodman So they remounted the SawHorse Tip holding to the post the Pumpkinhead clinging to Tip and the Scarecrow with both arms around the wooden form of Jack 115 Full page lineart drawing TIP STUFFS THE SCARECROW WITH DRY STRAW 116 Go slowly for now there is no danger of pursuit said Tip to his steed All right responded the creature in a voice rather gruff Arent you a little hoarse asked the Pumpkinhead politely The SawHorse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward toward Tip See here he growled cant you protect me from insult To be sure answered Tip soothingly I am sure Jack meant no harm And it will not do for us to quarrel you know we must all remain good friends Ill have nothing more to do with that Pumpkinhead declared the Saw Horse viciously he loses his head too easily to suit me There seemed no fitting reply to this speech so for a time they rode along in silence After a while the Scarecrow remarked This reminds me of old times It was upon this grassy knoll that I once saved Dorothy from the Stinging Bees of the Wicked Witch of the West Do Stinging Bees injure pumpkins asked Jack glancing around fearfully They are all dead so it doesnt matter replied 117 the Scarecrow And here is where Nick Chopper destroyed the Wicked Witchs Grey Wolves Who was Nick Chopper asked Tip That is the name of my friend the Tin Woodman answered his Majesty And here is where the Winged Monkeys captured and bound us and flew away with little Dorothy he continued after they had traveled a little way farther Do Winged Monkeys ever eat pumpkins asked Jack with a shiver of fear I do not know but you have little cause to worry for t
