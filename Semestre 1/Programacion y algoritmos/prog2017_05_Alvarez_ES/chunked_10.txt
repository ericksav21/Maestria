 have my oilcan and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witchs kiss and that will protect you from harm But Toto said the girl anxiously What will protect him We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the Tin Woodman Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws But to the Lions surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still Little Toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the Lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when Dorothy fearing Toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out Dont you dare to bite Toto You ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog I didnt bite him said the Lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it No but you tried to she retorted You are nothing but a big coward I know it said the Lion hanging his head in shame Ive always known it But how can I help it I dont know Im sure To think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor Scarecrow Is he stuffed asked the Lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again Of course hes stuffed replied Dorothy who was still angry Thats why he went over so easily remarked the Lion It astonished me to see him whirl around so Is the other one stuffed also No said Dorothy hes made of tin And she helped the Woodman up again Thats why he nearly blunted my claws said the Lion When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back What is that little animal you are so tender of He is my dog Toto answered Dorothy Is he made of tin or stuffed asked the Lion Neither Hes aaa meat dog said the girl Oh Hes a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that I look at him No one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the Lion sadly What makes you a coward asked Dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse Its a mystery replied the Lion I suppose I was born that way All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way Whenever Ive met a man Ive been awfully scared but I just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me I should have run myselfIm such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course I let them go But that isnt right The King of Beasts shouldnt be a coward said the Scarecrow I know it returned the Lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail It is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy But whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast Perhaps you have heart disease said the Tin Woodman It may be said the Lion If you have continued the Tin Woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart For my part I have no heart so I cannot have heart disease Perhaps said the Lion thoughtfully if I had no heart I should not be a coward Have you brains asked the Scarecrow I suppose so Ive never looked to see replied the Lion I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some remarked the Scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw And I am going to ask him to give me a heart said the Woodman And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas added Dorothy Do you think Oz could give me courage asked the Cowardly Lion Just as easily as he could give me brains said the Scarecrow Or give me a heart said the Tin Woodman Or send me back to Kansas said Dorothy Then if you dont mind Ill go with you said the Lion for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage You will be very welcome answered Dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily They really are said the Lion but that doesnt make me any braver and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy So once more the little company set off upon the journey the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothys side Toto did not approve of this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lions great jaws But after a time he became more at ease and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey Once indeed the Tin
