Soldier felt sure he never could pilot these gleaming airplanes On No No NO The Wizard frowned at the mere thought of war These are pleasure planes for traveling and exploring the unknown regions of the upper air As soon as Ozma returns from the South I plan to present them both to our illustrious young Ruler and arrange for her to make the first triumphant flight But there are two said Dorothy a little wistfully She had hoped to make the first flight with the Wizard herself Of course of course he answered in a matteroffact way Most experimental flights fail because they depend on one ship We shall have two We Dorothy brightened up considerably at the Wizards plural Yes we repeated the Wizard turning round to smile at the little girl Counting Ozma and those of us here there will be eight passengers C4 four for each plane Now please dont bother about me begged the Cowardly Lion his tail dragging on the ground at the very thought of flying Id not think of troubling you Besides Im much too heavy for flying Not at all not at all the Wizard reassured him with a wink I have made exact calculations about weight old fellow and you and the Scarecrow balance each other nicely So dont worry about that Oh Im not worrying about that rumbled the lion rearing up on his hind legs to read the names outlined in emeralds on the luminous sides of the Wizards ships Ozpril and Oztober The lion spoke in a slightly trembling roar Mmmn Mmmnnmn Kerumph Why those are beautiful names exclaimed Dorothy tilting back her head to spell them out for herself I thought they were rather neat said the Wizard complacently Suitable too one to rise and one to fall Expressively he lifted an arm and let it fall limply to his side To C4 to fall quavered the lion dropping to all fours Oh just in a figurative way of course The Wizard shrugged his shoulders You will observe he went on enthusiastically that these planes need no runway or special track to take off They really are balloonaplanes Note those round packets on the top of the fuselage The lion blinked rapidly for he had no idea that fuselage meant the body of the plane but the others nodded quite knowingly Well those declared the inventor proudly are my own patented balloon attachments At the touch of a button the wings are depressed and the balloon inflated with a magic gas lighter than helium that carries the ship as high and as far as desired Then the balloon can be deflated and the Ozoplane can continue under its own power But you will readily see how my ship with its balloon attachment has twice the altitude possibilities of an ordinary airplane Hah We shall fly higher than higher boasted the little Wizard happily Oh quite agreed the Tin Woodman mounting the ladder of the Oztober the Soldier with Green Whiskers pressing nervously at his heels But how will you move them out of here inquired the Scarecrow taking off his hat and scratching his cotton head Oh as to thatFF20C4 The Wizard pulled a switch just behind him whereupon the top of the glass airdrome lifted like the lid of an enormous jewel box Hmmmn I see The Scarecrow slapped his knee and grinned with appreciation Off with the roof Up with the planes Exactly Seizing the Straw Mans arm the Wizard urged him toward the ladder of the Ozpril Dorothy skipping cheerfully behind them After Dorothy plodded the Cowardly Lion talking to himself in anxious whispers and growls Be sure not to touch anything over there called the Wizard as Nick and the Soldier with Green Whiskers disappeared into the cabin of the other plane Ill keep an eye on them promised Jellia tripping up the ladder as lightly as a feather Dont give us a thought Wiz dear Jellias so funny laughed Dorothy Sensible too added the Wizard helping the little girl over the high door sill and into the plane While he and the Scarecrow went forward to examine the steering gear Dorothy looked delightedly round the snug little cabin There were four seats upholstered in pale green leather along one side The whole top was of thick glass through which she could distinctly see the moon and stars winking down at her The side walls of the Ozpril were of a silvery grey with all trimmings in green At the back was a small dinette with chairs and table locked to the floors as they are on seagoing vessels A cabinet full of china a wall full of charts a bookcase full of books and a tiny kitchen and dressing room completed the equipment Its just as cozy as a little house sighed Dorothy contentedly as the Cowardly Lion having glanced round in a discouraged way seated himself in one of the green chairs and pressed his nose against the round window pane Wont we have fun Liony when we really get off Getting off will be the best fun of all sniffed the lion glancing briefly at the door The Lion as you probably have guessed felt no enthusiasm for the trip Once much against his will he had been carried to an island in the sky and that experience had been more than enough In his own mind he already had decided n
