r eggs There was ample room for Randy beneath the Elegant Elephant and standing between his front legs the young monarch lifted the waterproof and reaching out caught a huge hailstone in his hand Touching it against his parched lips Randy gave a sigh of content then crunching it up rapturously stuck out his head and let the pelting downpour cool his hot and dusty face Wonder if this will put out the desert he mused ducking back as a terrible clap of thunder boomed like a cannonshot overhead SAY its a lucky thing youre so big Kabumpo he called up cheerily or wed be blown away Whee listen to that wind would you Have to do more than listen howled the Elegant Elephant bracing his feet and lowering his head Ahoy below Catch hold of something Randy Help Hi Hold on HOLD ON For the love of blue C4 mountains Here we GO Here we blow Oooomph Blooomph KerAHHHH Oh no Kabumpo NO Leaping up Randy caught the Elegant Elephants broad belt Put on C4 the brakes Quick And Kabumpo did try making a futile stand against the tearing wind But the mighty gale whistling under his waterproof filled it up and out like a balloon and with a regular ferryboat blast Kabumpo rose into the air and zoomed like a Zeppelin over the Deadly Desert while Randy hanging grimly to the strap of his belt banged to and fro like the clapper on a bell CHAPTER 6 THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESERT Remembering the deadly and destroying nature of the sands below Randy did not dare to look down Besides holding on took all his strength and attention for Kabumpo was borne like a leaf before the howling gale faster and faster and faster till he and Randy were too dazed and dizzy to know or care how far they had gone or where they were blowing to Which was perhaps just as well for as suddenly as it had risen the gale abated and coasting down the last high hill of the wind saved from a serious crash only by his faithful tarpaulin which now acted as a parachute Kabumpo came jolting to earth With closed eyes and trunk held stiffly before him the Elegant Elephant remained perfectly motionless awaiting destruction and wondering vaguely how it would feel He was convinced that they had come down on the desert itself Then as no fierce blasts of heat assailed him he ventured to open one eye Randy shaken loose by the force of the landing had rolled to the ground a few feet away and now jumping to his feet cried joyously Why its over Kabumpo Over and so are we Ho I never knew you could fly old PushtheFoot Neither did I shuddered the Elegant Elephant and jerking off the waterproof he flung it as hard and as far as he could Oh dont do that Randy dashed away to pick it up That good old coat saved our bacon and ballooned us across the desert as light as a couple of daisies But were no better off on this side than on the other grumbled Kabumpo surveying the barren countryside with positive hatred Not a house a field a farm or a castle in sight The idea was to get away from castles wasnt it Randy grinned up at his huge friend and folding the waterproof into a neat packet tucked it back in its place Well theres one thing about castles observed the Elegant Elephant giving his robe a quick tug here and there At least the foods regular I could eat a royal dinner from soup to napkins Give me a boost up that tree and Ill have a look around proposed Randy Need a spy glass to find anything worth looking at in this country complained Kabumpo lifting Randy into the fork of a gnarled old tree Shinning expertly up the rough trunk Randy looked carefully in all directions We certainly cleared the desert by a nice margin he called down gaily Its at least a mile behind us and toward the east I see a cluster of white towers that might be a castle And nothing between mourned Kabumpo with a hungry swallow no fields orchards or melon patches There are fields but theyre too far away for me to see whats growing and theres a forest too What country is this Kabumpo Do you know Depends on how we blew answered the Elegant Elephant lifting Randy out of the tree and tossing him lightly over his shoulder If we blew straight from Headland which is certainly the northwestern tip of the Gilliken Country of Oz we should be in No Land If we blew slantwise this would be Ix Then I hope we blew slantwise Randy spread himself out luxuriously behind Kabumpos ears For if we are in Ix we have only one country to cross before we reach Ev and Jinnickys castle And the sooner we start the sooner well arrive agreed Kabumpo swinging into motion But if I drop in my tracks boy dont be too surprised Im hollow as a drum and weak as a violet Too bad were not like the Headmen said Randy who felt dreadfully hollow himself Without a body I suppose one does not feel hungry Wonder what became of them anyway Who cares sniffed Kabumpo picking his way crossly through the rocks and brambles They probably blew about for a while but with ears like sails whats a gale of wind or weather Ho Whats that I see yonder a farmer No just a hat stuck on a pole
