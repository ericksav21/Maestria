s assistance Among these exiles were Matteo Guidi Nardo Scolari Lapo Uberti Gerozzo Nardi and Piero Buonaccorsi all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces and in order to gain greater weight in affairs he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti the Prince of Milan and organized for him the forces of his city and the country districts As Lucca had five gates he divided his own country districts into five parts which he supplied with arms and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa While he surrounded himself with these forces and allies it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza who had driven out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own territories so that being attacked at home they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves Castruccio invaded the Valdarno and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato inflicting immense damage upon the country Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army which had scarcely reached Tuscany when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family who were so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio but even advance him to the dignity of prince and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards for their services as they deserved they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca They found their opportunity one morning and arming themselves they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt but Stefano di Poggio a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they had taken them up Castruccio having heard the news of what had happened at Lucca at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army and with a troop of cavalry set out for home Contrary to his expectations he found the rebellion at an end yet he posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him he sought him out and without saying anything on his own behalf for he did not recognize any need for doing so he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth their former friendships and the obligations which Castruccio was under to their house To this Castruccio graciously responded and begged Stefano to reassure himself declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce which they readily entertained for they were weary of the war and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it A treaty was concluded with them for two years by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made Castruccio thus released from this trouble turned his attention to affairs in Lucca and in order that he should not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped he under various pretences and reasons first wiped out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality not sparing one of them but depriving them of country and property and those whom he had in his hands of life also stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be trusted Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines and strengthened his position in Lucca he neglected no opportunity short of open war of increasing his importance elsewhere It appeared to him that if he could get possession of Pistoia he would have one foot in Florence which was his great desire He therefore in various ways made friends with the mountaineers and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided their
