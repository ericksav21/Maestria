s of this tribe Nicolo Machiavel laid down this for a master rule in his political scheme That the show of religion was helpful to the politician but the reality of it hurtful and pernicious For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the abovenamed five qualities that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful faithful humane upright and religious There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand because it belongs to everybody to see you to few to come in touch with you Every one sees what you appear to be few really know what you are and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many who have the majesty of the state to defend them and in the actions of all men and especially of princes which it is not prudent to challenge one judges by the result For that reason let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state the means will always be considered honest and he will be praised by everybody because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it and in the world there are only the vulgar for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on One prince of the present time whom it is not well to name never preaches anything else but peace and good faith and to both he is most hostile and either if he had kept it would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time Ferdinand of Aragon When Machiavelli was writing The Prince it would have been clearly impossible to mention Ferdinands name here without giving offence Burds Il Principe p 308 CHAPTER XIX THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED Now concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above I have spoken of the more important ones the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality that the prince must consider as has been in part said before how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible and as often as he shall have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches It makes him hated above all things as I have said to be rapacious and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects from both of which he must abstain And when neither their property nor their honor is touched the majority of men live content and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few whom he can curb with ease in many ways It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle frivolous effeminate meanspirited irresolute from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness courage gravity and fortitude and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against for provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people he can only be attacked with difficulty For this reason a prince ought to have two fears one from within on account of his subjects the other from without on account of external powers From the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies and if he is well armed he will have good friends and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy and even should affairs outside be disturbed if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said as long as he does not despair he will resist every attack as I said Nabis the Spartan did But concerning his subjects when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised and by keeping the people satisfied with him which it is most necessary for him to accomplish as I said above at length And one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them he will not have the courage to take such a course for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite And as experience shows many have been the conspiracies but few have been successful because he who conspires cannot act alone nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage so that seeing the gain from this co
