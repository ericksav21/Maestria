hat time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their lord There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of Uguccione Castruccio also brought into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi Having fixed upon a plan to be followed Castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti filling it with supplies and munitions of war in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need When the night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione who had occupied the plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men the signal was given and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the portcullis Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side Uguccione entered with his men poured through the town and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters The governor was driven out and the government reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione to the detriment of the city because it was found that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time Of those who fled part went to Florence and part to Pistoia which city was the headquarters of the Guelph party and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca They assembled a large army in the Val di Nievole and seized Montecatini from thence they marched to Montecarlo in order to secure the free passage into Lucca Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces and with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy he moved against the quarters of the Florentines who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo and within about two miles of the enemy and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence Owing to the illness of Uguccione the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy Uguccione finding himself growing worse went to Montecarlo to be cured and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs who thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head grew overconfident Castruccio observed this and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief he also showed signs of fear and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used On the other side the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio Presently deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened and having mastered their tactics he decided to join battle with them First he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle and his less reliable men on the wings of the army whereupon he did exactly the opposite putting his most valiant men on the flanks while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre Observing this order of battle he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army who as usual had come in their insolence to defy him He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings Thus when they came into contact with the enemy only the wings of the two armies became engaged whilst the center battalions remained out of action for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccios men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemys troops and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them or to give any assistance to their own flanks So without much difficulty Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack without having a chance of displaying their valour The defeat was complete and the loss in men very heavy there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany and also many princes who had come to help them among whom were Piero the brother of King Ruberto and Carlo his nephew and Filippo the lord o
