al But confining myself more to the particular I say that a prince may be seen happy today and ruined tomorrow without having shown any change of disposition or character This I believe arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length namely that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful Because men are seen in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him namely glory and riches to get there by various methods one with caution another with haste one by force another by skill one by patience another by its opposite and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end the other fail and similarly two men by different observances are equally successful the one being cautious the other impetuous all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times This follows from what I have said that two men working differently bring about the same effect and of two working similarly one attains his object and the other does not Changes in estate also issue from this for if to one who governs himself with caution and patience times and affairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful his fortune is made but if times and affairs change he is ruined if he does not change his course of action But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change both because he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to do and also because having always prospered by acting in one way he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it and therefore the cautious man when it is time to turn adventurous does not know how to do it hence he is ruined but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success Consider his first enterprise against Bologna Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive The Venetians were not agreeable to it nor was the King of Spain and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive the latter from fear the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples on the other hand he drew after him the King of France because that king having observed the movement and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians found it impossible to refuse him Therefore Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away with his plans arranged and everything fixed as any other pontiff would have done he would never have succeeded Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses and the others would have raised a thousand fears I will leave his other actions alone as they were all alike and they all succeeded for the shortness of his life did not let him experience the contrary but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously his ruin would have followed because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him I conclude therefore that fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways so long as the two are in agreement men are successful but unsuccessful when they fall out For my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious because fortune is a woman and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and illuse her and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly She is therefore always womanlike a lover of young men because they are less cautious more violent and with more audacity command her CHAPTER XXVI AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses and wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a new prince and whether there were elements that would give an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this country it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present And if as I said it was necessary that the people of Israel should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the soul of Cyrus and
