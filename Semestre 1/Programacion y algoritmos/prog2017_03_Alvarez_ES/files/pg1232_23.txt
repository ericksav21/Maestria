fortune brought about a third event so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choice because having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna and the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors against all expectation both his and others it so came to pass that he did not become prisoner to his enemies they having fled nor to his auxiliaries he having conquered by other arms than theirs The Florentines being entirely without arms sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles The Emperor of Constantinople to oppose his neighbours sent ten thousand Turks into Greece who on the war being finished were not willing to quit this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the infidels Joannes Cantacuzenus born 1300 died 1383 Therefore let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries because with them the ruin is ready made they are all united all yield obedience to others but with mercenaries when they have conquered more time and better opportunities are needed to injure you they are not all of one community they are found and paid by you and a third party which you have made their head is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you In conclusion in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous in auxiliaries valour The wise prince therefore has always avoided these arms and turned to his own and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others not deeming that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries taking there only French soldiers and with them he captured Imola and Forli but afterwards such forces not appearing to him reliable he turned to mercenaries discerning less danger in them and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli whom presently on handling and finding them doubtful unfaithful and dangerous he destroyed and turned to his own men And the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke when he had the French when he had the Orsini and Vitelli and when he relied on his own soldiers on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples but I am unwilling to leave out Hiero the Syracusan he being one of those I have named above This man as I have said made head of the army by the Syracusans soon found out that a mercenary soldiery constituted like our Italian condottieri was of no use and it appearing to him that he could neither keep them not let them go he had them all cut to pieces and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament applicable to this subject David offered himself to Saul to fight with Goliath the Philistine champion and to give him courage Saul armed him with his own weapons which David rejected as soon as he had them on his back saying he could make no use of them and that he wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife In conclusion the arms of others either fall from your back or they weigh you down or they bind you fast Charles the Seventh the father of King Louis the Eleventh having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own and he established in his kingdom ordinances concerning menatarms and infantry Afterwards his son King Louis abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers which mistake followed by others is as is now seen a source of peril to that kingdom because having raised the reputation of the Switzers he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms for he has destroyed the infantry altogether and his menatarms he has subordinated to others for being as they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers it does not appear that they can now conquer without them Hence it arises that the French cannot stand against the Switzers and without the Switzers they do not come off well against others The armies of the French have thus become mixed partly mercenary and partly national both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone but much inferior to ones own forces And this example proves it for the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained Charles VII of France surnamed The Victorious born 1403 died 1461 Louis XI son of the above born 1423 died 1483 But the scanty wisdom of man on entering into an affair which looks well at first cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it as I have said above of hectic fevers Therefore if he who rules a pri
