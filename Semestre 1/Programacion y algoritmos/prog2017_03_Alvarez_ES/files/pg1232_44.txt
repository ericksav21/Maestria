galia and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it Night having come and the tumult being silenced the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled Neither of them used words in keeping with their past lives Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino the Archbishop of Florence and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce After which news on 18th January 1502 in the castle of Pieve they also were strangled in the same way THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA WRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI And sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 12841328 It appears dearest Zanobi and Luigi a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter that all men or the larger number of them who have performed great deeds in the world and excelled all others in their day have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody and as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read them they are omitted I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career thus all success must be attributed to her Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born but like many others he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth as the course of this history will show It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men I think also that I ought to call your attention to his actions because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of Lucca but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate as so often happens in this world To this family was born a son Antonio who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio He had an only sister who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens any person could have access to it without difficulty One morning shortly after sunrise Madonna Dianora as the sister of Messer Antonio was called had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction and heard something resembling the cry of an infant Whereupon she went towards it and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother Partly wondering and partly fearing yet full of compassion she lifted it up and carried it to the house where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home When he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister They discussed between themselves what should be done and seeing that he was priest and that she had no children they finally determined to bring it up They had a nurse for it and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child They baptized it and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome and gave evidence of wit and discretion and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him Messer Antonio intended to make a priest of him and in time would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices and all his instruction was given with this object but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them he left off reading ecclesiastical books and turned to playing with arms delighting in noth
