l her hopes for many years on mercenaries and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were Thus it was that Charles King of France was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth but they were not the sins he imagined but those which I have related And as they were the sins of princes it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty With chalk in hand col gesso This is one of the bons mots of Alexander VI and refers to the ease with which Charles VIII seized Italy implying that it was only necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the country Cf The History of Henry VII by Lord Bacon King Charles had conquered the realm of Naples and lost it again in a kind of a felicity of a dream He passed the whole length of Italy without resistance so that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont to say That the Frenchmen came into Italy with chalk in their hands to mark up their lodgings rather than with swords to fight I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not if they are you cannot trust them because they always aspire to their own greatness either by oppressing you who are their master or others contrary to your intentions but if the captain is not skilful you are ruined in the usual way And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way whether mercenary or not I reply that when arms have to be resorted to either by a prince or a republic then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of a captain the republic has to send its citizens and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily it ought to recall him and when one is worthy to hold him by the laws so that he does not leave the command And experience has shown princes and republics singlehanded making the greatest progress and mercenaries doing nothing except damage and it is more difficult to bring a republic armed with its own arms under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free The Switzers are completely armed and quite free Of ancient mercenaries for example there are the Carthaginians who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the Romans although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains After the death of Epaminondas Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the Thebans and after victory he took away their liberty Duke Filippo being dead the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the Venetians and he having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio allied himself with them to crush the Milanese his masters His father Sforza having been engaged by Queen Johanna of Naples left her unprotected so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon in order to save her kingdom And if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms and yet their captains did not make themselves princes but have defended them I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance for of the able captains of whom they might have stood in fear some have not conquered some have been opposed and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved but every one will acknowledge that had he conquered the Florentines would have stood at his discretion Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him so they watched each other Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples But let us come to that which happened a short while ago The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli a most prudent man who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown If this man had taken Pisa nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting and if they held to him they must obey him The Venetians if their achievements are considered will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly This was before they turned to enterprises on land but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy And in the beginning of their expansion on land through not having much territory and because of their great reputation they had not much to fear from their captains but when they expanded as under Carmignuola they had a taste of this mistake for having found him a most valiant man they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership and on the other hand knowing how lukewarm he was in the war th
