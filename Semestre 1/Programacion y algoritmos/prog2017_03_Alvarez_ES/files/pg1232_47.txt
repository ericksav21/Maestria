f Taranto On the part of Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men among whom was Francesco the son of Uguccione who being young and rash was killed in the first onset This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him because it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of power but rather than diminished it Being of this mind he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it This occurred on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer they were driven off by Castruccio and the murderer escaped This affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione who was than at Pisa it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio He therefore sent for his son Neri who was the governor of Lucca and commissioned him to take Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death Castruccio fearing no evil went to the governor in a friendly way was entertained at supper and then thrown into prison But Neri fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed kept him alive in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa but it did not appear wise to him to turn back lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him But the Lucchese having heard of what had happened at Pisa availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city They first began to speak of it in private circles afterwards openly in the squares and streets then they raised a tumult and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be set at liberty Uguccione fearing that worse might happen released him from prison Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione who finding he had no resource but in flight rode away with his friends to Lombardy to the lords of Scale where he died in poverty But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one year Having obtained this and wishing to gain renown in war he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione and with the help of the Pisans with whom he had concluded a treaty he marched to Serezzana To capture this place he constructed a fort against it which is called today Zerezzanello in the course of two months Castruccio captured the town With the reputation gained at that siege he rapidly seized Massa Carrara and Lavenza and in a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana In order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini who was the lord of it After this victory he returned to Lucca and was welcomed by the whole people And now Castruccio deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a prince got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio Puccinello dal Portico Francesco Boccansacchi and Cecco Guinigi all of whom he had corrupted and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people At this time Frederick of Bavaria the King of the Romans came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown and Castruccio in order that he might make friends with him met him at the head of five hundred horsemen Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca Pagolo Guinigi who was held in high estimation because of the peoples love for the memory of his father Castruccio was received in great honour by Frederick and many privileges were conferred upon him and he was appointed the emperors lieutenant in Tuscany At this time the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca whom they had driven out of Pisa and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa and the Pisans in dread of the Guelph party and particularly of the Florentines were constrained to accept him as their lord Frederick having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian affairs returned to Germany All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines who followed the imperial lead had recourse to Castruccio for help and counsel and all promised him the governorship of his country if enabled to recover it with hi
