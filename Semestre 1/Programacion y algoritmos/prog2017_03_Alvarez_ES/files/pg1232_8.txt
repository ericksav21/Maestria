 their goodwill he can easily keep down the more powerful of them so as to remain entirely master in the country And he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles The Romans in the countries which they annexed observed closely these measures they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with the minor powers without increasing their strength they kept down the greater and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority Greece appears to me sufficient for an example The Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled Antiochus was driven out yet the merits of the Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do who have to regard not only present troubles but also future ones for which they must prepare with every energy because when foreseen it is easy to remedy them but if you wait until they approach the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable for it happens in this as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect but in the course of time not having been either detected or treated in the beginning it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure This it happens in affairs of state for when the evils that arise have been foreseen which it is only given to a wise man to see they can be quickly redressed but when through not having been foreseen they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them there is no longer a remedy Therefore the Romans foreseeing troubles dealt with them at once and even to avoid a war would not let them come to a head for they knew that war is not to be avoided but is only to be put off to the advantage of others moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy they could have avoided both but this they did not wish nor did that ever please them which is for ever in the mouths of the wise ones of our timeLet us enjoy the benefits of the timebut rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence for time drives everything before it and is able to bring with it good as well as evil and evil as well as good See remark in the introduction on the word intrattenere But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned I will speak of Louis and not of Charles as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed he having held possession of Italy for the longest period and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements Louis XII King of France The Father of the People born 1462 died 1515 Charles VIII King of France born 1470 died 1498 King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention I will not blame the course taken by the king because wishing to get a foothold in Italy and having no friends thereseeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charleshe was forced to accept those friendships which he could get and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes The king however having acquired Lombardy regained at once the authority which Charles had lost Genoa yielded the Florentines became his friends the Marquess of Mantua the Duke of Ferrara the Bentivogli my lady of Forli the Lords of Faenza of Pesaro of Rimini of Camerino of Piombino the Lucchese the Pisans the Sieneseeverybody made advances to him to become his friend Then could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them which in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy had made the king master of twothirds of Italy Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid down and kept all his friends secure and protected for although they were numerous they were both weak and timid some afraid of the Church some of the Venetians and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful But he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal p
