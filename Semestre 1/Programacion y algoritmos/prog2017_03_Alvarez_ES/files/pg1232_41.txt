lose combat Owing to this as has been and may again be seen the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions who follow the same tactics as the Swiss when the Spaniards by agility of body and with the aid of their shields got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger able to attack while the Germans stood helpless and if the cavalry had not dashed up all would have been over with them It is possible therefore knowing the defects of both these infantries to invent a new one which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry this need not create a new order of arms but a variation upon the old And these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new prince This opportunity therefore ought not to be allowed to pass for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear Nor can one express the love with which he would be received in all those provinces which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings with what thirst for revenge with what stubborn faith with what devotion with what tears What door would be closed to him Who would refuse obedience to him What envy would hinder him What Italian would refuse him homage To all of us this barbarous dominion stinks Let therefore your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken so that under its standard our native country may be ennobled and under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch Virtu contro al Furore Prendera larme e fia il combatter corto Che lantico valore Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto Virtue against fury shall advance the fight And it i th combat soon shall put to flight For the old Roman valour is not dead Nor in th Italians brests extinguished Edward Dacre 1640 DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO THE SIGNOR PAGOLO AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy where he had been to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana and had arrived at Imola whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli the tyrant of Bologna for he intended to bring that city under his domination and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their following it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful and it was feared that having seized Bologna he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy Upon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia to which came the cardinal Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini Vitellozzo Vitelli Oliverotto da Fermo Gianpagolo Baglioni the tyrant of Perugia and Messer Antonio da Venafro sent by Pandolfo Petrucci the Prince of Siena Here were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli but to strive to win over the Florentines and they send their men to one place and another promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy and those who were discontented under the duke among whom were the people of Urbino took hope of effecting a revolution Thus it arose that mens minds being thus unsettled it was decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo which was held for the duke and which they captured by the following means The castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there so the conspirators watched and when certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress Upon this capture being effected the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke being encouraged in this not so much by the capture of the fort as by the Diet at Magione from whom they expected to get assistance Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the opportunity and at once assembled their men so as to take any town should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the common firebrand showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity But the Florentines from hat
