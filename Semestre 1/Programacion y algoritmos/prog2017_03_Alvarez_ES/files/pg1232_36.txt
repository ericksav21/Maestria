e second case when those who fight are of such a character that you have no anxiety as to who may conquer so much the more is it greater prudence to be allied because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who if he had been wise would have saved him and conquering as it is impossible that he should not do with your assistance he remains at your discretion And here it is to be noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others unless necessity compels him as is said above because if he conquers you are at his discretion and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one The Venetians joined with France against the Duke of Milan and this alliance which caused their ruin could have been avoided But when it cannot be avoided as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy then in such a case for the above reasons the prince ought to favour one of the parties Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles and for choice to take the lesser evil A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability and to honour the proficient in every art At the same time he should encourage his citizens to practise their callings peaceably both in commerce and agriculture and in every other following so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes but the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and designs in any way to honour his city or state Further he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year and as every city is divided into guilds or into societies he ought to hold such bodies in esteem and associate with them sometimes and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality nevertheless always maintaining the majesty of his rank for this he must never consent to abate in anything Guilds or societies in arti o in tribu Arti were craft or trade guilds cf Florio Arte a whole company of any trade in any city or corporation town The guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject Methuen 1906 Institutions of a somewhat similar character called artel exist in Russia today cf Sir Mackenzie Wallaces Russia ed 1905 The sons were always during the working season members of an artel In some of the larger towns there are artels of a much more complex kind permanent associations possessing large capital and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual members The word artel despite its apparent similarity has Mr Aylmer Maude assures me no connection with ars or arte Its root is that of the verb rotisya to bind oneself by an oath and it is generally admitted to be only another form of rota which now signifies a regimental company In both words the underlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath Tribu were possibly gentile groups united by common descent and included individuals connected by marriage Perhaps our words sects or clans would be most appropriate CHAPTER XXII CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince And the first opinion which one forms of a prince and of his understanding is by observing the men he has around him and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful But when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him for the prime error which he made was in choosing them There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci Prince of Siena who would not consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant Because there are three classes of intellects one which comprehends by itself another which appreciates what others comprehended and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others the first is the most excellent the second is good the third is useless Therefore it follows necessarily that if Pandolfo was not in the first rank he was in the second for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done although he himself may not have the initiative yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant and the one he can praise and the other correct thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him and is kept honest But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one test w
