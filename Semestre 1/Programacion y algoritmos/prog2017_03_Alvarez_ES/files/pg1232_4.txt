royed the French rule in Italy and left Francis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival Charles V This was followed by the sack of Rome upon the news of which the popular party at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici who were once more banished Machiavelli was absent from Florence at this time but hastened his return hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the Ten of Liberty and Peace Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached Florence where he died on 22nd June 1527 THE MAN AND HIS WORKS No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest but modern Florence has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce by the side of her most famous sons recognizing that whatever other nations may have found in his works Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe Whilst it is idle to protest against the worldwide and evil signification of his name it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day and that the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more reasonably It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an unholy necromancer which so long haunted mens vision has begun to fade Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation acuteness and industry noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced retirement from affairs He does not present himself nor is he depicted by his contemporaries as a type of that rare combination the successful statesman and author for he appears to have been only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political employments He was misled by Catherina Sforza ignored by Louis XII overawed by Cesare Borgia several of his embassies were quite barren of results his attempts to fortify Florence failed and the soldiery that he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice In the conduct of his own affairs he was timid and timeserving he dared not appear by the side of Soderini to whom he owed so much for fear of compromising himself his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to write the History of Florence rather than employ him in the state And it is on the literary side of his character and there alone that we find no weakness and no failure Although the light of almost four centuries has been focused on The Prince its problems are still debatable and interesting because they are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers Such as they are its ethics are those of Machiavellis contemporaries yet they cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe rely on material rather than on moral forces Its historical incidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and conduct Leaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action The Prince is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn Men are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed as they were in the days of Alexander VI The cloak of religion still conceals the vices which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon Men will not look at things as they really are but as they wish them to beand are ruined In politics there are no perfectly safe courses prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones Thento pass to a higher planeMachiavelli reiterates that although crimes may win an empire they do not win glory Necessary wars are just wars and the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to fight It is the cry of a far later day than Machiavellis that government should be elevated into a living moral force capable of inspiring the people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society to this high argument The Prince contributes but little Machiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than as he found them and he writes with such skill and insight that his work is of abiding value But what invests The Prince with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours In translating The Prince my aim has been to achieve at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original rather than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression Machiavelli was no facile phrasemonger the conditions under which he wrote obliged him to weigh every word his themes were lofty his substance grave his manner nobly plain and serious Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis rebus in definiendis in explanandis pressior In The
