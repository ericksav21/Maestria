icily One morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people these dead he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians and ultimately besieged yet not only was he able to defend his city but leaving part of his men for its defence with the others he attacked Africa and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse The Carthaginians reduced to extreme necessity were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles and leaving Sicily to him had to be content with the possession of Africa Agathocles the Sicilian born 361 BC died 289 BC Therefore he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing or little which can be attributed to fortune inasmuch as he attained preeminence as is shown above not by the favour of any one but step by step in the military profession which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellowcitizens to deceive friends to be without faith without mercy without religion such methods may gain empire but not glory Still if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain Nevertheless his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius In our times during the rule of Alexander the Sixth Oliverotto da Fermo having been left an orphan many years before was brought up by his maternal uncle Giovanni Fogliani and in the early days of his youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli that being trained under his discipline he might attain some high position in the military profession After Pagolo died he fought under his brother Vitellozzo and in a very short time being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind he became the first man in his profession But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others he resolved with the aid of some citizens of Fermo to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty and with the help of the Vitelleschi to seize Fermo So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that having been away from home for many years he wished to visit him and his city and in some measure to look upon his patrimony and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour yet in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain he desired to come honourably so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen his friends and retainers and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians all of which would be not only to his honour but also to that of Giovanni himself who had brought him up Giovanni therefore did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians and he lodged him in his own house where having passed some days and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare and of their enterprises to which discourse Giovanni and others answered but he rose at once saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place and he betook himself to a chamber whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest After these murders Oliverotto mounted on horseback rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace so that in fear the people were forced to obey him and to form a government of which he made himself the prince He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances in such a way that in the year during which he held the principality not only was he secure in the city of Fermo but he had become formidable to all his neighbours And his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia as was stated above Thus one year after he had committed this parricide he was strangled together with Vitellozzo whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles and his l
