ike after infinite treacheries and cruelties should live for long secure in his country and defend himself from external enemies and never be conspired against by his own citizens seeing that many others by means of cruelty have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state still less in the doubtful times of war I believe that this follows from severities being badly or properly used Those may be called properly used if of evil it is possible to speak well that are applied at one blow and are necessary to ones security and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects The badly employed are those which notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement multiply with time rather than decrease Those who practise the first system are able by aid of God or man to mitigate in some degree their rule as Agathocles did It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern equivalent of Machiavellis thought when he speaks of crudelta than the more obvious cruelties Hence it is to be remarked that in seizing a state the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them and win them to himself by benefits He who does otherwise either from timidity or evil advice is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand neither can he rely on his subjects nor can they attach themselves to him owing to their continued and repeated wrongs For injuries ought to be done all at one time so that being tasted less they offend less benefits ought to be given little by little so that the flavour of them may last longer And above all things a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances whether of good or evil shall make him change because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times you are too late for harsh measures and mild ones will not help you for they will be considered as forced from you and no one will be under any obligation to you for them CHAPTER IX CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY But coming to the other pointwhere a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country not by wickedness or any intolerable violence but by the favour of his fellow citizensthis may be called a civil principality nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to it but rather a happy shrewdness I say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one of three results either a principality selfgovernment or anarchy A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity for the nobles seeing they cannot withstand the people begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves and they make him a prince so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions The people finding they cannot resist the nobles also cry up the reputation of one of themselves and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking But he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone and has none around him or few who are not prepared to obey him Besides this one cannot by fair dealing and without injury to others satisfy the nobles but you can satisfy the people for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles the latter wishing to oppress while the former only desire not to be oppressed It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people because of their being too many whilst from the nobles he can secure himself as they are few in number The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment but also that they will rise against him for they being in these affairs more farseeing and astute always come forward in time to save themselves and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail Further the prince is compelled to live always with the same people but he can do well without the same nobles being able to make and unmake them daily and to give or take away authority when it pleases him Therefore to make this point clearer I say that the nobles ought
