ted by the prince knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest and does it utmost to support him and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way There are for example the Spartans and the Romans The Spartans held Athens and Thebes establishing there an oligarchy nevertheless they lost them The Romans in order to hold Capua Carthage and Numantia dismantled them and did not lose them They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it making it free and permitting its laws and did not succeed So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it may expect to be destroyed by it for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget And whatever you may do or provide against they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed but at every chance they immediately rally to them as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the Florentines But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince and his family is exterminated they being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves and they do not know how to govern themselves For this reason they are very slow to take up arms and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily But in republics there is more vitality greater hatred and more desire for vengeance which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there CHAPTER VI CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONES OWN ARMS AND ABILITY Let no one be surprised if in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state because men walking almost always in paths beaten by others and following by imitation their deeds are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men and to imitate those who have been supreme so that if his ability does not equal theirs at least it will savour of it Let him act like the clever archers who designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains take aim much higher than the mark not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach I say therefore that in entirely new principalities where there is a new prince more or less difficulty is found in keeping them accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state Now as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties Nevertheless he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest Further it facilitates matters when the prince having no other state is compelled to reside there in person But to come to those who by their own ability and not through fortune have risen to be princes I say that Moses Cyrus Romulus Theseus and such like are the most excellent examples And although one may not discuss Moses he having been a mere executor of the will of God yet he ought to be admired if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with God But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms all will be found admirable and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered they will not be found inferior to those of Moses although he had so great a preceptor And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them Without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished and without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain It was necessary therefore to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba and that he should be abandoned at his birth in order that he should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland It was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace Theseus could not have shown his a
