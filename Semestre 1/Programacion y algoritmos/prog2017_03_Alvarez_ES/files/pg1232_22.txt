ey feared they would no longer conquer under him and for this reason they were not willing nor were they able to let him go and so not to lose again that which they had acquired they were compelled in order to secure themselves to murder him They had afterwards for their captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo Roberto da San Severino the count of Pitigliano and the like under whom they had to dread loss and not gain as happened afterwards at Vaila where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much trouble Because from such arms conquests come but slowly long delayed and inconsiderable but the losses sudden and portentous Battle of Caravaggio 15th September 1448 Johanna II of Naples the widow of Ladislao King of Naples Giovanni Acuto An English knight whose name was Sir John Hawkwood He fought in the English wars in France and was knighted by Edward III afterwards he collected a body of troops and went into Italy These became the famous White Company He took part in many wars and died in Florence in 1394 He was born about 1320 at Sible Hedingham a village in Essex He married Domnia a daughter of Bernabo Visconti Carmignuola Francesco Bussone born at Carmagnola about 1390 executed at Venice 5th May 1432 Bartolomeo Colleoni of Bergamo died 1457 Roberto of San Severino died fighting for Venice against Sigismund Duke of Austria in 1487 Primo capitano in Italia Machiavelli Count of Pitigliano Nicolo Orsini born 1442 died 1510 Battle of Vaila in 1509 And as with these examples I have reached Italy which has been ruled for many years by mercenaries I wish to discuss them more seriously in order that having seen their rise and progress one may be better prepared to counteract them You must understand that the empire has recently come to be repudiated in Italy that the Pope has acquired more temporal power and that Italy has been divided up into more states for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their nobles who formerly favoured by the emperor were oppressing them whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal power in many others their citizens became princes From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of republics and the Church consisting of priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms both commenced to enlist foreigners The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio the Romagnian From the school of this man sprang among others Braccio and Sforza who in their time were the arbiters of Italy After these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy and the end of all their valour has been that she has been overrun by Charles robbed by Louis ravaged by Ferdinand and insulted by the Switzers The principle that has guided them has been first to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own They did this because subsisting on their pay and without territory they were unable to support many soldiers and a few infantry did not give them any authority so they were led to employ cavalry with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured and affairs were brought to such a pass that in an army of twenty thousand soldiers there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers They had besides this used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers not killing in the fray but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom They did not attack towns at night nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch nor did they campaign in the winter All these things were permitted by their military rules and devised by them to avoid as I have said both fatigue and dangers thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt Alberigo da Conio Alberico da Barbiano Count of Cunio in Romagna He was the leader of the famous Company of St George composed entirely of Italian soldiers He died in 1409 CHAPTER XIII CONCERNING AUXILIARIES MIXED SOLDIERY AND ONES OWN Auxiliaries which are the other useless arm are employed when a prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend as was done by Pope Julius in the most recent times for he having in the enterprise against Ferrara had poor proof of his mercenaries turned to auxiliaries and stipulated with Ferdinand King of Spain for his assistance with men and arms These arms may be useful and good in themselves but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous for losing one is undone and winning one is their captive Ferdinand V F II of Aragon and Sicily F III of Naples surnamed The Catholic born 1542 died 1516 And although ancient histories may be full of examples I do not wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second the peril of which cannot fail to be perceived for he wishing to get Ferrara threw himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner But his good
