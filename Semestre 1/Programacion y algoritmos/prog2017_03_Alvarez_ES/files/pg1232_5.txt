Prince it may be truly said there is reason assignable not only for every word but for the position of every word To an Englishman of Shakespeares time the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy task for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language to the Englishman of today it is not so simple To take a single example the word intrattenere employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece would by an Elizabethan be correctly rendered entertain and every contemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that Rome entertained the Aetolians and the Achaeans without augmenting their power But today such a phrase would seem obsolete and ambiguous if not unmeaning we are compelled to say that Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians etc using four words to do the work of one I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to the sense If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that the reader in his eagerness to reach the authors meaning may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it The following is a list of the works of Machiavelli Principal works Discorso sopra le cose di Pisa 1499 Del modo di trattare i popoli della Valdichiana ribellati 1502 Del modo tenuto dal duca Valentino nell ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli Oliverotto da Fermo etc 1502 Discorso sopra la provisione del danaro 1502 Decennale primo poem in terza rima 1506 Ritratti delle cose dell Alemagna 150812 Decennale secondo 1509 Ritratti delle cose di Francia 1510 Discorsi sopra la prima deca di T Livio 3 vols 151217 Il Principe 1513 Andria comedy translated from Terence 1513 Mandragola prose comedy in five acts with prologue in verse 1513 Della lingua dialogue 1514 Clizia comedy in prose 1515 Belfagor arcidiavolo novel 1515 Asino doro poem in terza rima 1517 Dell arte della guerra 151920 Discorso sopra il riformare lo stato di Firenze 1520 Sommario delle cose della citta di Lucca 1520 Vita di Castruccio Castracani da Lucca 1520 Istorie fiorentine 8 books 15215 Frammenti storici 1525 Other poems include Sonetti Canzoni Ottave and Canti carnascialeschi Editions Aldo Venice 1546 della Tertina 1550 Cambiagi Florence 6 vols 17825 dei Classici Milan 10 1813 Silvestri 9 vols 18202 Passerini Fanfani Milanesi 6 vols only published 18737 Minor works Ed F L Polidori 1852 Lettere familiari ed E Alvisi 1883 2 editions one with excisions Credited Writings ed G Canestrini 1857 Letters to F Vettori see A Ridolfi Pensieri intorno allo scopo di N Machiavelli nel libro Il Principe etc D Ferrara The Private Correspondence of Nicolo Machiavelli 1929 DEDICATION To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De Medici Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious or in which they see him take most delight whence one often sees horses arms cloth of gold precious stones and similar ornaments presented to princes worthy of their greatness Desiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with some testimony of my devotion towards you I have not found among my possessions anything which I hold more dear than or value so much as the knowledge of the actions of great men acquired by long experience in contemporary affairs and a continual study of antiquity which having reflected upon it with great and prolonged diligence I now send digested into a little volume to your Magnificence And although I may consider this work unworthy of your countenance nevertheless I trust much to your benignity that it may be acceptable seeing that it is not possible for me to make a better gift than to offer you the opportunity of understanding in the shortest time all that I have learnt in so many years and with so many troubles and dangers which work I have not embellished with swelling or magnificent words nor stuffed with rounded periods nor with any extrinsic allurements or adornments whatever with which so many are accustomed to embellish their works for I have wished either that no honour should be given it or else that the truth of the matter and the weightiness of the theme shall make it acceptable Nor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the concerns of princes because just as those who draw landscapes place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the nature of the mountains and of lofty places and in order to contemplate the plains place themselves upon high mountains even so to understand the nature of the people it needs to be a prince and to understand that of princes it needs to be of the people Take then your Magnificence this little gift in the spirit in which I send it wherein if it be diligently read and considered by you you will learn my extreme desire that you should
