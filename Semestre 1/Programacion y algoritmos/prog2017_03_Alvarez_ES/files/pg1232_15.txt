 his own power and ability But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword He left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated with the rest in the air between two most powerful hostile armies and sick unto death Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid that if he had not had those armies on his back or if he had been in good health he would have overcome all difficulties And it is seen that his foundations were good for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month In Rome although but half alive he remained secure and whilst the Baglioni the Vitelli and the Orsini might come to Rome they could not effect anything against him If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected But if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander everything would have been different to him On the day that Julius the Second was elected he told me that he had thought of everything that might occur at the death of his father and had provided a remedy for all except that he had never anticipated that when the death did happen he himself would be on the point to die Alexander VI died of fever 18th August 1503 Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere Cardinal of San Pietro ad Vincula born 1443 died 1513 When all the actions of the duke are recalled I do not know how to blame him but rather it appears to be as I have said that I ought to offer him for imitation to all those who by the fortune or the arms of others are raised to government Because he having a lofty spirit and farreaching aims could not have regulated his conduct otherwise and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs Therefore he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality to win friends to overcome either by force or fraud to make himself beloved and feared by the people to be followed and revered by the soldiers to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him to change the old order of things for new to be severe and gracious magnanimous and liberal to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second in whom he made a bad choice because as is said not being able to elect a Pope to his own mind he could have hindered any other from being elected Pope and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became pontiffs For men injure either from fear or hatred Those whom he had injured amongst others were San Pietro ad Vincula Colonna San Giorgio and Ascanio The rest in becoming Pope had to fear him Rouen and the Spaniards excepted the latter from their relationship and obligations the former from his influence the kingdom of France having relations with him Therefore above everything the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope and failing him he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived Therefore the duke erred in his choice and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario Ascanio is Ascanio Sforza CHAPTER VIII CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them although one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics These methods are when either by some wicked or nefarious ways one ascends to the principality or when by the favour of his fellowcitizens a private person becomes the prince of his country And speaking of the first method it will be illustrated by two examplesone ancient the other modernand without entering further into the subject I consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them Agathocles the Sicilian became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position This man the son of a potter through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life Nevertheless he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that having devoted himself to the military profession he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse Being established in that position and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence without obligation to others that which had been conceded to him by assent he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar the Carthaginian who with his army was fighting in S
