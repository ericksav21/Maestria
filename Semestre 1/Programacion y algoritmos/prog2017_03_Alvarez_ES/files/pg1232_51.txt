efeat caused the Florentines great anxiety and despairing of preserving their liberty they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples offering him the dominion of their city and he knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause was to him accepted it He agreed with the Florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins and he send his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the pressure of Castruccios army owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi one of the first men in Pisa who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese He had formed this conspiracy intending to seize the citadel kill the partisans of Castruccio and drive out the garrison As however in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy so for its execution a few are not sufficient and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death and beheaded many other noble citizens and drove their families into exile It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected he employed much thought and energy upon securing his position there and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their army and to await the coming of Carlo the son of the King of Naples When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalryhaving called to their aid every Guelph there was in Italy They consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first and decided that it would be better to march on the lattera course owing to the recent conspiracy more likely to succeed and of more advantage to them because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa In the early part of May 1328 the Florentines put in motion this army and quickly occupied Lastra Signa Montelupo and Empoli passing from thence on to San Miniato When Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him he was in no degree alarmed believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better fight or had better prospects of success than at Pisa or Serravalle He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen and with this army went to Fucecchio whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain Moreover the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa nor could they get through to Pisa or attack Castruccios forces except at a disadvantage In one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies the one under his own command and the other under Pagolo and in the other case they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy an undertaking of great hazard In order to tempt the Florentines to take this latter course Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river The Florentines having occupied San Miniato held a council of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio and having weighed the difficulties of both courses they decided upon the latter The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen On the morning of 10 June 1328 the Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry Castruccio whose plan of action was fixed and who well knew what to do at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them he also sent one thousand light infantry up the river bank and the same number down the Arno The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river and this
