ft thee if a smaller state at least with fewer enemies and perils because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries But I would have made both these peoples my friends and I should have lived if no longer at least more peacefully and have left you a state without a doubt smaller but one more secure and established on a surer foundation But Fortune who insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs did not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first nor the time to surmount it Thou hast heard for many have told thee and I have never concealed it how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boya stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should feeland how I was brought up by him and loved as though I had been born of his blood how under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune of which thou hast been witness When thy good father came to die he committed thee and all his possessions to my care and I have brought thee up with that love and increased thy estate with that care which I was bound to show And in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained I have never married so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father Thus I leave thee a vast estate of which I am well content but I am deeply concerned inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands which will never rest contented under they government Thou hast also Pisa where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable who although they may be sometimes held in subjection yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese Pistoia is also disloyal to thee she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines injured by us in a thousand ways but not utterly destroyed who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all Tuscany In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance for they are far distant slow and their help is very long in coming Therefore thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities and in the memory of my valour and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee which as thou knowest how to use it with prudence will assist thee to come to terms with the Florentines who as they are suffering under this great defeat should be inclined to listen to thee And whereas I have sought to make them my enemies because I believed that war with them would conduce to my power and glory thou hast every inducement to make friends of them because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security It is of the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself and the measure of his own strength and means and he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace And it will be well for thee to rule they conduct by my counsel and to learn in this way to enjoy what my lifework and dangers have gained and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me in that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa Pistoia and Lucca who had been fighting at his side and whilst recommending Pagolo to them and making them swear obedience to him as his successor he died He left a happy memory to those who had known him and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio for he had not the abilities Not long after the death of Castruccio Pagolo lost Pisa and then Pistoia and only with difficulty held on to Lucca This latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the greatgrandson of Pagolo From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities not only measured by men of his own time but also by those of an earlier date In stature he was above the ordinary height and perfectly proportioned He was of a gracious presence and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased His hair was inclined to be red and he wore it cut short above the ears and whether it rained or snowed he always went without a hat He was delightful among friends but terrible to his enemies just to his subjects ready to play false with the unfaithful and willi
