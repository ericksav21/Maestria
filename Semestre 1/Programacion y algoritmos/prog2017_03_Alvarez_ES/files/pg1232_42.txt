red for sundry reasons of the Vitelli and Orsini not only would not ally themselves but sent Nicolo Machiavelli their secretary to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies The duke was found full of fear at Imola because against everybodys expectation his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him and to negotiate for a reconciliation and also to get assistance This latter he obtained in two ways by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting menatarms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort to all he gave money Notwithstanding this his enemies drew near to him and approached Fossombrone where they encountered some men of the duke and with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli routed them When this happened the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it as it was enough for him to have the title of prince whilst others might have the principality And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation and they brought their army to a standstill But the duke did not stop his preparations and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna In the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in which he confirmed their former covenants he gave them four thousand ducats at once he promised not to injure the Bentivogli and he formed an alliance with Giovanni and moreover he would not force them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so On the other hand they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them to serve him in all his expeditions and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his permission This reconciliation being completed Guido Ubaldo the Duke of Urbino again fled to Venice having first destroyed all the fortresses in his state because trusting in the people he did not wish that the fortresses which he did not think he could defend should be held by the enemy since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends But the Duke Valentino having completed this convention and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna set out for Imola at the end of November together with his French menatarms thence he went to Cesena where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino as to the enterprise in which they should now take part but nothing being concluded Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready if he did not wish it then they would besiege Sinigalia To this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany and thus become hostile to the Florentines but that he was very willing to proceed against Sinigalia It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person therefore they exhorted him to come there This appeared a good opportunity to the duke as being invited by them and not going of his own will he would awaken no suspicions And the more to reassure them he allowed all the French menatarms who were with him in Lombardy to depart except the hundred lancers under Mons di Candales his brotherinlaw He left Cesena about the middle of December and went to Fano and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his friends But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn for the death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him nevertheless persuaded by Pagolo Orsini whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises he agreed to wait Upon this the duke before his departure from Fano which was to be on 30th December 1502 communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers among whom were Don Miche
