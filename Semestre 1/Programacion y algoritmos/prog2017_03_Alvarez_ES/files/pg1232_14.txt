s of the Colonna house This came to him soon and he used it well for the Orsini perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia From this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna with endless dangers to the duke all of which he overcame with the help of the French Having restored his authority not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other outside forces he had recourse to his wiles and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that by the mediation of Signor Pagolowhom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention giving him money apparel and horsesthe Orsini were reconciled so that their simplicity brought them into his power at Sinigalia Having exterminated the leaders and turned their partisans into his friends the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity he gained them all over to himself And as this point is worthy of notice and to be imitated by others I am not willing to leave it out Sinigalia 31st December 1502 When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak masters who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them and gave them more cause for disunion than for union so that the country was full of robbery quarrels and every kind of violence and so wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority he considered it necessary to give it a good governor Thereupon he promoted Messer Ramiro dOrco a swift and cruel man to whom he gave the fullest power This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the greatest success Afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority for he had no doubt but that he would become odious so he set up a court of judgment in the country under a most excellent president wherein all cities had their advocates And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself so to clear himself in the minds of the people and gain them entirely to himself he desired to show that if any cruelty had been practised it had not originated with him but in the natural sternness of the minister Under this pretence he took Ramiro and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side The barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed Ramiro dOrco Ramiro de Lorqua But let us return whence we started I say that the duke finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way and having in a great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his conquest had next to consider France for he knew that the king who too late was aware of his mistake would not support him And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta It was his intention to secure himself against them and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived Such was his line of action as to present affairs But as to the future he had to fear in the first place that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him so he decided to act in four ways Firstly by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled so as to take away that pretext from the Pope Secondly by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid as has been observed Thirdly by converting the college more to himself Fourthly by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock Of these four things at the death of Alexander he had accomplished three For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on and few had escaped he had won over the Roman gentlemen and he had the most numerous party in the college And as to any fresh acquisition he intended to become master of Tuscany for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino and Pisa was under his protection And as he had no longer to study France for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill he pounced down upon Pisa After this Lucca and Siena yielded at once partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper as he was prospering the year that Alexander died for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others but solely on
