be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality because the sons of the old prince are not the heirs but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority and the sons remain only noblemen And this being an ancient custom it cannot be called a new principality because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones for although the prince is new the constitution of the state is old and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord But returning to the subject of our discourse I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been fatal to the abovenamed emperors and it will be recognized also how it happened that a number of them acting in one way and a number in another only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones Because it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander being new princes to imitate Marcus who was heir to the principality and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to Caracalla Commodus and Maximinus to have imitated Severus they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps Therefore a prince new to the principality cannot imitate the actions of Marcus nor again is it necessary to follow those of Severus but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm CHAPTER XX ARE FORTRESSES AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL 1 Some princes so as to hold securely the state have disarmed their subjects others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions others have fostered enmities against themselves others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments some have built fortresses some have overthrown and destroyed them And although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit 2 There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them because by arming them those arms become yours those men who were distrusted become faithful and those who were faithful are kept so and your subjects become your adherents And whereas all subjects cannot be armed yet when those whom you do arm are benefited the others can be handled more freely and this difference in their treatment which they quite understand makes the former your dependents and the latter considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward excuse you But when you disarm them you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them either for cowardice or for want of loyalty and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you And because you cannot remain unarmed it follows that you turn to mercenaries which are of the character already shown even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects Therefore as I have said a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms Histories are full of examples But when a prince acquires a new state which he adds as a province to his old one then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it and these again with time and opportunity should be rendered soft and effeminate and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you 3 Our forefathers and those who were reckoned wise were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for today because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist The Venetians moved as I believe by the above reasons fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed yet they nursed these disputes amongst them so that the citizens distracted by their differences should not unite against them Which as we saw did not afterwards turn out as expected because after the rout at Vaila one party at once took courage and seized the state Such methods argue therefore weakness
