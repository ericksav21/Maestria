ower to the spiritual thus giving it greater authority And having committed this prime error he was obliged to follow it up so much so that to put an end to the ambition of Alexander and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany he was himself forced to come into Italy And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church and deprived himself of friends he wishing to have the kingdom of Naples divides it with the King of Spain and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king he drove him out to put one there who was able to drive him Louis out in turn The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common and men always do so when they can and for this they will be praised not blamed but when they cannot do so yet wish to do so by any means then there is folly and blame Therefore if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she ought to have done so if she could not then she ought not to have divided it And if the partition which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in Italy this other partition merited blame for it had not the excuse of that necessity Therefore Louis made these five errors he destroyed the minor powers he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy he brought in a foreign power he did not settle in the country he did not send colonies Which errors had he lived were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the Venetians because had he not aggrandized the Church nor brought Spain into Italy it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them but having first taken these steps he ought never to have consented to their ruin for they being powerful would always have kept off others from designs on Lombardy to which the Venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there also because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order to give it to the Venetians and to run counter to both they would not have had the courage And if any one should say King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war I answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war because it is not to be avoided but is only deferred to your disadvantage And if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage and for the cap to Rouen to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes and how it ought to be kept Louis XII divorced his wife Jeanne daughter of Louis XI and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany widow of Charles VIII in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the crown The Archbishop of Rouen He was Georges dAmboise created a cardinal by Alexander VI Born 1460 died 1510 Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them Nor is there any miracle in this but much that is reasonable and quite natural And on these matters I spoke at Nantes with Rouen when Valentino as Cesare Borgia the son of Pope Alexander was usually called occupied the Romagna and on Cardinal Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war I replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France and her ruin may be attributed to them From this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power CHAPTER IV WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly acquired state some might wonder how seeing that Alexander the Great became the master of Asia in a few years and died whilst it was scarcely settled whence it might appear reasonable that the whole empire would have rebelled nevertheless his successors maintained themselves and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways either by a prince with a body of servants who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission or by a prince and barons who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood a
