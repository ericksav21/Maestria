ught to murder him and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him Afterwards he sought him out in France and took from him his government and life He who will therefore carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox he will find him feared and respected by every one and not hated by the army and it need not be wondered at that he a new man was able to hold the empire so well because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man and had very excellent qualities which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers for he was a warlike man most enduring of fatigue a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries which caused him to be beloved by the armies Nevertheless his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that after endless single murders he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria He became hated by the whole world and also feared by those he had around him to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion And here it must be noted that suchlike deaths which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage cannot be avoided by princes because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state Antoninus had not taken this care but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion whom also he daily threatened yet retained in his bodyguard which as it turned out was a rash thing to do and proved the emperors ruin But let us come to Commodus to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire for being the son of Marcus he had inherited it and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers but being by nature cruel and brutal he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people on the other hand not maintaining his dignity often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators and doing other vile things little worthy of the imperial majesty he fell into contempt with the soldiers and being hated by one party and despised by the other he was conspired against and was killed It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus He was a very warlike man and the armies being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander of whom I have already spoken killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne This he did not possess for long for two things made him hated and despised the one his having kept sheep in Thrace which brought him into contempt it being well known to all and considered a great indignity by every one and the other his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the imperial seat he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire practised many cruelties so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity First Africa rebelled then the Senate with all the people of Rome and all Italy conspired against him to which may be added his own army this latter besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it were disgusted with his cruelties and fearing him less when they found so many against him murdered him I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus Macrinus or Julian who being thoroughly contemptible were quickly wiped out but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree because notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence that is soon done none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces as were the armies of the Roman Empire and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people it is now more necessary to all princes except the Turk and the Soldan to satisfy the people rather the soldiers because the people are the more powerful From the above I have excepted the Turk who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom and it is necessary that putting aside every consideration for the people he should keep them his friends The kingdom of the Soldan is similar being entirely in the hands of soldiers it follows again that without regard to the people he must keep them his friends But you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities for the reason that it is like the Christian pontificate which cannot
