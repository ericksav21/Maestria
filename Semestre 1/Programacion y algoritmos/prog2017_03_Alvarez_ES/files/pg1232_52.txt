being deep with mud many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting they withdrew them and moved higher up the river hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward who being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry The horses alarmed by the noise and the wounds would not move forward and trampled each other in great confusion The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle whilst the Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few At length Castruccio seeing how long the battle had lasted and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted and that both sides had many killed and wounded pushed forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccios reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other because Castruccio knowing his inferiority in this arm had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry This fell out as he had hoped for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy This they did with lance and javelin and joined by their own cavalry fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight The Florentine captains having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river in order to attack the flanks of Castruccios army But here also the banks were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio and this movement was quite useless Thus the Florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped and Castruccio was again covered with glory Many captains were taken prisoners and Carlo the son of King Ruberto with Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi the Florentine commissioners fled to Empoli If the spoils were great the slaughter was infinitely greater as might be expected in such a battle Of the Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirtyone men whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserved it and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stopped him Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day and when the end of it came although fatigued and overheated he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and personally thank them He was also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it Here Castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno and which is often very unhealthy from this he took a chill of which he thought nothing as he was accustomed to such troubles but it was the cause of his death On the following night he was attacked with high fever which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal Castruccio therefore called Pagolo Guinigi to him and addressed him as follows If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes promised I should have laboured less and I should have le
