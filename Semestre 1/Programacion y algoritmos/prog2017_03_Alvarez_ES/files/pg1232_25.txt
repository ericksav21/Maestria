with our army with whom would be the advantage How should one best advance to meet him keeping the ranks If we should wish to retreat how ought we to pursue And he would set forth to them as he went all the chances that could befall an army he would listen to their opinion and state his confirming it with reasons so that by these continual discussions there could never arise in time of war any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with Philopoemen the last of the Greeks born 252 BC died 183 BC But to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories and study there the actions of illustrious men to see how they have borne themselves in war to examine the causes of their victories and defeat so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former and above all do as an illustrious man did who took as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his mind as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles Caesar Alexander Scipio Cyrus And whoever reads the life of Cyrus written by Xenophon will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory and how in chastity affability humanity and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon A wise prince ought to observe some such rules and never in peaceful times stand idle but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows CHAPTER XV CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and friends And as I know that many have written on this point I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people But it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done sooner effects his ruin than his preservation for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong and to make use of it or not according to necessity Therefore putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince and discussing those which are real I say that all men when they are spoken of and chiefly princes for being more highly placed are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise and thus it is that one is reputed liberal another miserly using a Tuscan term because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own one is reputed generous one rapacious one cruel one compassionate one faithless another faithful one effeminate and cowardly another bold and brave one affable another haughty one lascivious another chaste one sincere another cunning one hard another easy one grave another frivolous one religious another unbelieving and the like And I know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed for human conditions do not permit it it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose him his state and also to keep himself if it be possible from those which would not lose him it but this not being possible he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them And again he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty for if everything is considered carefully it will be found that something which looks like virtue if followed would be his ruin whilst something else which looks like vice yet followed brings him security and prosperity CHAPTER XVI CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS Commencing then with the first of the abovenamed characteristics I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal Nevertheless liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it injures you for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised it may not become known and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite Therefore any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence so that a prince thus inclined will consume in su
