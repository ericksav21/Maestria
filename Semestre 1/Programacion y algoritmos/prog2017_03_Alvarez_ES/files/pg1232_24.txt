ncipality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him he is not truly wise and this insight is given to few And if the first disaster to the Roman Empire should be examined it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others Many speakers to the House the other night in the debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the British Empire maintains its existence When Mr Balfour replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under the weight of its military obligations he said that this was wholly unhistorical He might well have added that the Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to fight for the State but that it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer recognizedPall Mall Gazette 15th May 1906 I conclude therefore that no principality is secure without having its own forces on the contrary it is entirely dependent on good fortune not having the valour which in adversity would defend it And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength And ones own forces are those which are composed either of subjects citizens or dependents all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries And the way to make ready ones own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon and if one will consider how Philip the father of Alexander the Great and many republics and princes have armed and organized themselves to which rules I entirely commit myself CHAPTER XIV THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR A prince ought to have no other aim or thought nor select anything else for his study than war and its rules and discipline for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules and it is of such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank And on the contrary it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art Francesco Sforza through being martial from a private person became Duke of Milan and the sons through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms from dukes became private persons For among other evils which being unarmed brings you it causes you to be despised and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself as is shown later on Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants Because there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion it is not possible for them to work well together And therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned cannot be respected by his soldiers nor can he rely on them He ought never therefore to have out of his thoughts this subject of war and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war this he can do in two ways the one by action the other by study As regards action he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled to follow incessantly the chase by which he accustoms his body to hardships and learns something of the nature of localities and gets to find out how the mountains rise how the valleys open out how the plains lie and to understand the nature of rivers and marshes and in all this to take the greatest care Which knowledge is useful in two ways Firstly he learns to know his country and is better able to undertake its defence afterwards by means of the knowledge and observation of that locality he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter because the hills valleys and plains and rivers and marshes that are for instance in Tuscany have a certain resemblance to those of other countries so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess for it teaches him to surprise his enemy to select quarters to lead armies to array the battle to besiege towns to advantage Philopoemen Prince of the Achaeans among other praises which writers have bestowed on him is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war and when he was in the country with friends he often stopped and reasoned with them If the enemy should be upon that hill and we should find ourselves here
