ing so much as in learning their uses and in running leaping and wrestling with other boys In all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength and if at any time he did turn to books only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family named Messer Francesco whose profession was arms and who in riches bodily strength and valour excelled all other men in Lucca He had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta which is at the top of the square of San Michele the finest square in Lucca and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them and that they loved and obeyed him Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him Therefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman where he would learn to ride horses and use arms or in the house of a priest where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church Messer Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of even though he stood silent blushing modestly but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak he answered that if his master were agreeable nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier This reply delighted Messer Francesco and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman In the first place he became an accomplished horseman and could manage with ease the most fiery charger and in all jousts and tournaments although still a youth he was observed beyond all others and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity But what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others for he was deferential to the great men modest with his equals and courteous to his inferiors These gifts made him beloved not only by all the Guinigi family but by all Lucca When Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines and with him went Castruccio in charge of his forces Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this expedition acquiring greater reputation than any other captain and his name and fame were known not only in Pavia but throughout all Lombardy Castruccio having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he left it did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends as he could neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that purpose About this time Messer Francesco died leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo and having appointed Castruccio to be his sons tutor and administrator of his estate Before he died Francesco called Castruccio to him and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he Francesco had always shown to HIM and to render to the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father Upon the death of Francesco Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo which increased enormously his power and position and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi the head of the Guelph party This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca but it seemed to him that Castruccio with the great abilities which he already showed and holding the position of governor deprived him of his opportunity therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence Castruccio at first treated this with scorn but afterwards he grew alarmed thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca The Lord of Pisa at t
