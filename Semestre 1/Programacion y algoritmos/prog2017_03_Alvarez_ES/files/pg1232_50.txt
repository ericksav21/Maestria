d steep whilst in general it ascends gently but is still narrow especially at the summit where the waters divide so that twenty men side by side could hold it The lord of Serravalle was Manfred a German who before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians and unclaimed by eitherneither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality and came under obligations to no one For these reasons and also because the castle was well fortified he had always been able to maintain his position It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy for here his few men would have the advantage and there was no fear lest seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged they should not stand As soon as this trouble with Florence arose Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines and the castellan put to death Castruccio having prepared everything had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle intending to cross the hill on the following morning In the meantime Castruccio had seized the castle at night had also moved his army from Montecarlo and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence had reached the foot of Serravalle thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill nor were they aware of his having seized the castle Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own although some few of them got through When the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below it was filled with confusion The cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward owing to the narrowness of the pass and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done In a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the enemys infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout resistance Retreat had been impossible with the mountains on both flanks whilst in front were their enemies and in the rear their friends When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy These orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack but gave way and were soon in full retreatconquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy Those in the rear turned towards Pistoia and spread through the plains each man seeking only his own safety The defeat was complete and very sanguinary Many captains were taken prisoners among whom were Bandini dei Rossi Francesco Brunelleschi and Giovanni della Tosa all Florentine noblemen with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine side having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the Guelphs and surrendered to Castruccio He was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno but marched his army into the plain of Peretola about two miles from Florence Here he remained many days dividing the spoils and celebrating his victory with feasts and games holding horse races and foot races for men and women He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence who were to open the city gates at night but the conspiracy was discovered and the participators in it taken and beheaded among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi This d
