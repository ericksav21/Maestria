selves should seize more territory Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians To restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary as it was for the defence of Ferrara and to keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome who being divided into two factions Orsini and Colonnesi had always a pretext for disorder and standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff kept the pontificate weak and powerless And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope such as Sixtus yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness for in the ten years which is the average life of a pope he can with difficulty lower one of the factions and if so to speak one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi another would arise hostile to the Orsini who would support their opponents and yet would not have time to ruin the Orsini This was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494 Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to prevail and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino and by reason of the entry of the French he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke And although his intention was not to aggrandize the Church but the duke nevertheless what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church which after his death and the ruin of the duke became the heir to all his labours Pope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong possessing all the Romagna the barons of Rome reduced to impotence and through the chastisements of Alexander the factions wiped out he also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been practised before Alexanders time Such things Julius not only followed but improved upon and he intended to gain Bologna to ruin the Venetians and to drive the French out of Italy All of these enterprises prospered with him and so much the more to his credit inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance nevertheless he held two things firm the one the greatness of the Church with which he terrified them and the other not allowing them to have their own cardinals who caused the disorders among them For whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and out of it and the barons are compelled to support them and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo found the pontificate most powerful and it is to be hoped that if others made it great in arms he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de Medici CHAPTER XII HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss and having considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad and having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to hold them it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence and defence which belong to each of them We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin The chief foundations of all states new as well as old or composite are good laws and good arms and as there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms I say therefore that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own or they are mercenaries auxiliaries or mixed Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous and if one holds his state based on these arms he will stand neither firm nor safe for they are disunited ambitious and without discipline unfaithful valiant before friends cowardly before enemies they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is for in peace one is robbed by them and in war by the enemy The fact is they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe which I should have little trouble to prove for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting al
