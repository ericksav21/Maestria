d but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls The first case has been discussed but we will speak of it again should it recur In the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns and not on any account to defend the country And whoever shall fortify his town well and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above and to be often repeated will never be attacked without great caution for men are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified and is not hated by his people The cities of Germany are absolutely free they own but little country around them and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits them nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult seeing they have proper ditches and walls they have sufficient artillery and they always keep in public depots enough for one years eating drinking and firing And beyond this to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city and on the pursuit of which the people are supported they also hold military exercises in repute and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them Therefore a prince who has a strong city and had not made himself odious will not be attacked or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace again because that the affairs of this world are so changeable it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with And whoever should reply If the people have property outside the city and see it burnt they will not remain patient and the long siege and selfinterest will make them forget their prince to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold Further the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence and therefore so much the less ought the prince to hesitate because after a time when spirits have cooled the damage is already done the ills are incurred and there is no longer any remedy and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive Therefore if everything is well considered it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last when he does not fail to support and defend them CHAPTER XI CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune and they can be held without either for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion which are so allpowerful and of such a character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live These princes alone have states and do not defend them and they have subjects and do not rule them and the states although unguarded are not taken from them and the subjects although not ruled do not care and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves Such principalities only are secure and happy But being upheld by powers to which the human mind cannot reach I shall speak no more of them because being exalted and maintained by God it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them Nevertheless if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church has attained such greatness in temporal power seeing that from Alexander backwards the Italian potentates not only those who have been called potentates but every baron and lord though the smallest have valued the temporal power very slightlyyet now a king of France trembles before it and it has been able to drive him from Italy and to ruin the Venetiansalthough this may be very manifest it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory Before Charles King of France passed into Italy this country was under the dominion of the Pope the Venetians the King of Naples the Duke of Milan and the Florentines These potentates had two principal anxieties the one that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms the other that none of them
