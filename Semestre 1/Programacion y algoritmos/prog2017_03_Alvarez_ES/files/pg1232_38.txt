nable a new prince to appear well established and render him at once more secure and fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there For the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood because men are attracted more by the present than by the past and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality and adorned and strengthened it with good laws good arms good allies and with a good example so will it be a double disgrace to him who born a prince shall lose his state by want of wisdom And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in Italy in our times such as the King of Naples the Duke of Milan and others there will be found in them firstly one common defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length in the next place some one of them will be seen either to have had the people hostile or if he has had the people friendly he has not known how to secure the nobles In the absence of these defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost Philip of Macedon not the father of Alexander the Great but he who was conquered by Titus Quintius had not much territory compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles he sustained the war against his enemies for many years and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities nevertheless he retained the kingdom Therefore do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their principalities after so many years possession but rather their own sloth because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest and when afterwards the bad times came they thought of flight and not of defending themselves and they hoped that the people disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors would recall them This course when others fail may be good but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you This again either does not happen or if it does it will not be for your security because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself those only are reliable certain and durable that depend on yourself and your valour CHAPTER XXV WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER It is not unknown to me how many men have had and still have the opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and that no one can even help them and because of this they would have us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs but to let chance govern them This opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen and may still be seen every day beyond all human conjecture Sometimes pondering over this I am in some degree inclined to their opinion Nevertheless not to extinguish our free will I hold it to be true that Fortune is the arbiter of onehalf of our actions but that she still leaves us to direct the other half or perhaps a little less Frederick the Great was accustomed to say The older one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty King Chance does threequarters of the business of this miserable universe Sorels Eastern Question I compare her to one of those raging rivers which when in flood overflows the plains sweeping away trees and buildings bearing away the soil from place to place everything flies before it all yield to its violence without being able in any way to withstand it and yet though its nature be such it does not follow therefore that men when the weather becomes fair shall not make provision both with defences and barriers in such a manner that rising again the waters may pass away by canal and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous So it happens with fortune who shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her and thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her And if you will consider Italy which is the seat of these changes and which has given to them their impulse you will see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence For if it had been defended by proper valour as are Germany Spain and France either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it would not have come at all And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in gener
