 to be looked at mainly in two ways that is to say they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune or they do not Those who so bind themselves and are not rapacious ought to be honoured and loved those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage in which case you ought to make use of them especially of those who are of good counsel and thus whilst in prosperity you honour them in adversity you do not have to fear them But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you and a prince ought to guard against such and to fear them as if they were open enemies because in adversity they always help to ruin him Therefore one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him But one who in opposition to the people becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles ought above everything to seek to win the people over to himself and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection Because men when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil are bound more closely to their benefactor thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours and the prince can win their affections in many ways but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules so I omit them but I repeat it is necessary for a prince to have the people friendly otherwise he has no security in adversity Nabis Prince of the Spartans sustained the attack of all Greece and of a victorious Roman army and against them he defended his country and his government and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile And do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that He who builds on the people builds on the mud for this is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there and persuades himself that the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates wherein he would find himself very often deceived as happened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali in Florence But granted a prince who has established himself as above who can command and is a man of courage undismayed in adversity who does not fail in other qualifications and who by his resolution and energy keeps the whole people encouragedsuch a one will never find himself deceived in them and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well Nabis tyrant of Sparta conquered by the Romans under Flamininus in 195 BC killed 192 BC Messer Giorgio Scali This event is to be found in Machiavellis Florentine History Book III These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of government for such princes either rule personally or through magistrates In the latter case their government is weaker and more insecure because it rests entirely on the goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy and who especially in troubled times can destroy the government with great ease either by intrigue or open defiance and the prince has not the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority because the citizens and subjects accustomed to receive orders from magistrates are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions and there will always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust For such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times when citizens have need of the state because then every one agrees with him they all promise and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him but in troubled times when the state has need of its citizens then he finds but few And so much the more is this experiment dangerous inasmuch as it can only be tried once Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him and then he will always find them faithful CHAPTER X CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities that is whether a prince has such power that in case of need he can support himself with his own resources or whether he has always need of the assistance of others And to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can either by abundance of men or money raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the fiel
