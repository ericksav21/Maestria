bility had he not found the Athenians dispersed These opportunities therefore made those men fortunate and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and made famous Those who by valorous ways become princes like these men acquire a principality with difficulty but they keep it with ease The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans whilst the others defend lukewarmly in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them It is necessary therefore if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others that is to say whether to consummate their enterprise have they to use prayers or can they use force In the first instance they always succeed badly and never compass anything but when they can rely on themselves and use force then they are rarely endangered Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered and the unarmed ones have been destroyed Besides the reasons mentioned the nature of the people is variable and whilst it is easy to persuade them it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion And thus it is necessary to take such measures that when they believe no longer it may be possible to make them believe by force If Moses Cyrus Theseus and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for longas happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise for all their dangers are in the ascent yet with ability they will overcome them but when these are overcome and those who envied them their success are exterminated they will begin to be respected and they will continue afterwards powerful secure honoured and happy To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one still it bears some resemblance to them and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind it is Hiero the Syracusan This man rose from a private station to be Prince of Syracuse nor did he either owe anything to fortune but opportunity for the Syracusans being oppressed chose him for their captain afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince He was of so great ability even as a private citizen that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king This man abolished the old soldiery organized the new gave up old alliances made new ones and as he had his own soldiers and allies on such foundations he was able to build any edifice thus whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring he had but little in keeping Hiero II born about 307 BC died 216 BC CHAPTER VII CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising but much in keeping atop they have not any difficulties on the way up because they fly but they have many when they reach the summit Such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it as happened to many in Greece in the cities of Ionia and of the Hellespont where princes were made by Darius in order that they might hold the cities both for his security and his glory as also were those emperors who by the corruption of the soldiers from being citizens came to empire Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated themtwo most inconstant and unstable things Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position because unless they are men of great worth and ability it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command having always lived in a private condition besides they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful States that rise unexpectedly then like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies fixed in such a way that the first
