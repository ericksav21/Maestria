in the prince because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace but if war comes this policy proves fallacious 4 Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted and therefore fortune especially when she desires to make a new prince great who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one causes enemies to arise and form designs against him in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them and by them to mount higher as by a ladder which his enemies have raised For this reason many consider that a wise prince when he has the opportunity ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself so that having crushed it his renown may rise higher 5 Princes especially new ones have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted Pandolfo Petrucci Prince of Siena ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others But on this question one cannot speak generally for it varies so much with the individual I will only say this that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves can always be gained over with the greatest ease and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who serving him in too much security may neglect his affairs And since the matter demands it I must not fail to warn a prince who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so and if it be not a natural affection towards him but only discontent with their government then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty for it will be impossible to satisfy them And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government and are therefore his enemies than of those who being discontented with it were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it 6 It has been a custom with princes in order to hold their states more securely to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them and as a place of refuge from a first attack I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly Notwithstanding that Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state Guido Ubaldo Duke of Urbino on returning to his dominion whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision Fortresses therefore are useful or not according to circumstances if they do you good in one way they injure you in another And this question can be reasoned thus the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone The castle of Milan built by Francesco Sforza has made and will make more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state For this reason the best possible fortress isnot to be hated by the people because although you may hold the fortresses yet they will not save you if the people hate you for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince unless to the Countess of Forli when the Count Girolamo her consort was killed for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan and thus recover her state and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her and when the people her enemy were allied with foreigners Therefore it would have been safer for her both then and before not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses All these things considered then I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not and I shall blame whoever trusting in them cares little about being hated by the people Catherine Sforza a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia Landriani born 1463 died 1509 It was to the Coun
