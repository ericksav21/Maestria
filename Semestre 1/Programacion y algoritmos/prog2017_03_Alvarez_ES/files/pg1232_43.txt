le and the Monsignor dEuna who was afterwards cardinal and he ordered that as soon as Vitellozzo Pagolo Orsini the Duke di Gravina and Oliverotto should arrive his followers in pairs should take them one by one entrusting certain men to certain pairs who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the dukes quarters where they should be seized The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro a river five miles distant from Fano and await him there He found himself therefore on the last day of December at the Metauro with his men and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him he then moved forward the infantry whom he accompanied with the rest of the menatarms Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of the Adriatic Sea fifteen miles distant from each other so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places The city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bowshot and from the shore about a mile On the side opposite to the city runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano facing the high road Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road along the mountains and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it and goes for the distance of a bowshot he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia not by a straight line but transversely Before this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke and to honour him in person sent away their men to several castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles so that room could be made for the men of the duke and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above Matters having been thus arranged the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over but having opened it one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the country and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed without stopping into the town Vitellozzo Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina on mules accompanied by a few horsemen went towards the duke Vitellozo unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green appeared very dejected as if conscious of his approaching deatha circumstance which in view of the ability of the man and his former fortune caused some amazement And it is said that when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them He recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune of their house but the virtues of their fathers that should be kept in mind These three therefore came before the duke and saluted him respectfully and were received by him with goodwill they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them But the duke noticing that Oliverotto who had remained with his band in Sinigalia was missingfor Oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river keeping his men in order and drilling themsignalled with his eye to Don Michelle to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed that he should take measures that Oliverotto should not escape Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters because these might be taken up by the men of the duke and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke And Oliverotto having taken this advice came before the duke who when he saw him called to him and Oliverotto having made his obeisance joined the others So the whole party entered Sinigalia dismounted at the dukes quarters and went with him into a secret chamber where the duke made them prisoners he then mounted on horseback and issued orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms Those of Oliverotto being at hand were quickly settled but those of the Orsini and Vitelli being at a distance and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters had time to prepare themselves and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves But the dukes soldiers not being content with having pillaged the men of Oliverotto began to sack Sini
