urse to be assured and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers he must be a very rare friend or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince to keep faith with you And to reduce the matter into a small compass I say that on the side of the conspirator there is nothing but fear jealousy prospect of punishment to terrify him but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality the laws the protection of friends and the state to defend him so that adding to all these things the popular goodwill it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime because on account of it he has the people for an enemy and thus cannot hope for any escape Endless examples could be given on this subject but I will be content with one brought to pass within the memory of our fathers Messer Annibale Bentivogli who was prince in Bologna grandfather of the present Annibale having been murdered by the Canneschi who had conspired against him not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni who was in childhood immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi This sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna which was so great that although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state the Bolognese having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government Giovanni Bentivogli born in Bologna 1438 died at Milan 1508 He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506 Machiavellis strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience February 1513 when he had been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem but when it is hostile to him and bears hatred towards him he ought to fear everything and everybody And wellordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation and to keep the people satisfied and contented for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king of these the first is the parliament and its authority because he who founded the kingdom knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in and on the other side knowing the hatred of the people founded in fear against the nobles he wished to protect them yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king therefore to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people and from the people for favouring the nobles he set up an arbiter who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom From this one can draw another important conclusion that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others and keep those of grace in their own hands And further I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles but not so as to make himself hated by the people It may appear perhaps to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them Wishing therefore to answer these objections I will recall the characters of some of the emperors and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus they were Marcus and his son Commodus Pertinax Julian Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla Macrinus Heliogabalus Alexander and Maximinus There is first to note that whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many for
