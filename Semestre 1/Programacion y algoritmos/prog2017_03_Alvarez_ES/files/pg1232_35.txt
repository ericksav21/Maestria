tess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499 A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the appointment I have been with the signori wrote Fortunati to learn whom they would send and when They tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli a learned young Florentine noble secretary to my Lords of the Ten is to leave with me at once Cf Catherine Sforza by Count Pasolini translated by P Sylvester 1898 CHAPTER XXI HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting a fine example We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon the present King of Spain He can almost be called a new prince because he has risen by fame and glory from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom and if you will consider his deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them He was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him Further always using religion as a plea so as to undertake greater schemes he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors nor could there be a more admirable example nor one more rare Under this same cloak he assailed Africa he came down on Italy he has finally attacked France and thus his achievements and designs have always been great and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them And his actions have arisen in such a way one out of the other that men have never been given time to work steadily against him Again it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal affairs similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano who when he had the opportunity by any one in civil life doing some extraordinary thing either good or bad would take some method of rewarding or punishing him which would be much spoken about And a prince ought above all things always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy that is to say when without any reservation he declares himself in favour of one party against the other which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows they are of such a character that if one of them conquers you have either to fear him or not In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously because in the first case if you do not declare yourself you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered and you will have no reasons to offer nor anything to protect or to shelter you Because he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly sword in hand court his fate Antiochus went into Greece being sent for by the Aetolians to drive out the Romans He sent envoys to the Achaeans who were friends of the Romans exhorting them to remain neutral and on the other hand the Romans urged them to take up arms This question came to be discussed in the council of the Achaeans where the legate of Antiochus urged them to stand neutral To this the Roman legate answered As for that which has been said that it is better and more advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war nothing can be more erroneous because by not interfering you will be left without favour or consideration the guerdon of the conqueror Thus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms And irresolute princes to avoid present dangers generally follow the neutral path and are generally ruined But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of one side if the party with whom he allies himself conquers although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy yet he is indebted to him and there is established a bond of amity and men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard especially to justice But if he with whom you ally yourself loses you may be sheltered by him and whilst he is able he may aid you and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again In th
