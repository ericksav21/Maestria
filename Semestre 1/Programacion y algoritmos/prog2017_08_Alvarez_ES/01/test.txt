Alibaba executive chairman Jack Ma on Wednesday announced the establishment of the Alibaba Discovery, Adventure, Momentum, and Outlook (DAMO) Academy in China to research artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and other emerging technologies. In an interview, DAMO Academy director Jeff Zhang says the academy wants to draw top talent in various fields, with the overall goal of forming "a deeper connection with our core business." Zhang says developing a series of solid theories of deep learning is currently the most critical issue in AI, and the academy will focus on "mastering the laws" of AI. Zhang notes much of Alibaba's concentration now involves creating "a perfect match between consumers and manufacturers, and this perfect match relies on data." Zhang says other research areas for the academy will include converting the voice-based AI technology that powers Alibaba's TMall Genie smart speaker into a standardized system that can be incorporated into other devices, such as children's toys.
